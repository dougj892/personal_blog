      <title>Fixed Effects vs Difference-in-Differences</title>

      <description>TL;DR: When you have longitudinal data, you should use fixed effects or ANCOVA rather than difference-in-differences since a difference-in-difference specification will spit out incorrect variance estimates. If the data is from a randomized trial, ANCOVA is probably a better bet.
Trying to understand when to use fixed effects and when to use difference-in-differences (DiD), in the past, always made me feel like an idiot. It seemed like I was missing something really obvious that everyone else was getting.</description>

      <description>This week, I volunteered to read and summarize one of the articles for IDinsigh&amp;rsquo;s tech team&amp;rsquo;s book club. The topic for this week is multiple hypothesis testing and the article I volunteered to summarize is &amp;ldquo;Multiple Inference and Gender Differences in the Effects of Early Intervention: A Reevaluation of the Abecedarian, Perry Preschool, and Early Training Projects&amp;rdquo; by Michael Anderson. You can find an ungated version of the article here.</description>
