  abstract = {The marks moderation debate, which made headlines this summer,1 resulted in a frenzied, but incomplete, media coverage. There has been litigation as well, stalling the declaration of high-school results of students of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), and various state boards. This brief aims to demonstrate how the reliance on a simplistic metric of a 101point (0 100) scale for awarding absolute scores in each subject has resulted in a nearcomplete breakdown of the assessment standards in Indian board examinations, largely because of the existence of multiple systems. The boards are competing to stay relevant by awarding increasingly high scores, thus diluting academic standards and pulling down the public's trust in the assessment system.},

  abstract = {Learning profiles show changes in student skills per year of schooling. Profiles are often shockingly shallow in developing countries in part because curricula move faster than the pace of learning. To demonstrate the consequences of curriculum mismatch, we construct a model that portrays learning as the result of synchronizing student skill and instructional levels. Our simulation shows that countries with identical potential learning could have divergent learning outcomes due to a gap between curricular and actual pace, and the country that goes faster has much lower cumulative learning. Paradoxically, there is greater learning potential if curricula and teachers slow down.},

  abstract = {I present the first value-added models of learning production in private and government schools in India using unique panel data from Andhra Pradesh state. I examine the heterogeneity in private school value-added across different subjects, urban and rural areas, medium of instruction, and across age groups. Further, I also estimate private school effects on children's self-efficacy and agency. In rural areas, I find a substantial positive effect ({$>$}0.5 SD) of private schools on English, no effect on mathematics and heterogeneous effects on Telugu for 8\textendash 10 year old students; at 15 years, there are modest effects ({$<$}0.2 SD) on mathematics and Telugu receptive vocabulary. I find no evidence of a positive effect in urban areas or on psychosocial skills. Results on comparable test domains and age groups correspond closely with, and further extend, estimates from a parallel experimental evaluation.},
