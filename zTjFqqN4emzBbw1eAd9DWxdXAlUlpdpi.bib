This essay reviews the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings of this work and documents the success of Goldin and Katzâ€™s framework in accounting for numerous broad labor market trends. The essay also considers areas where the framework falls short in explaining several key labor market puzzles of recent decades and argues that these shortcomings can potentially be overcome by relaxing the implicit equivalence drawn between workersâ€™ skills and their job tasks in the conceptual framework on which Goldin and Katz build. The essay argues that allowing for a richer set of interactions between skills and technologies in accomplishing job tasks both augments and refines the predictions of Goldin and Katzâ€™s approach and suggests an even more important role for human capital in economic growth than indicated by their analysis.},

We find that adverse rainfall in the year of birth decreases grade attainment, post-secondary enrollment, and employment outcomes. But children whose families were randomized to receive conditional cash transfers experienced a much smaller decline: each additional year of program exposure during childhood mitigated more than 20 percent of early disadvantage.},

We study Romanian school markets using administrative data, a survey, and an experiment. The administrative data show that, on average, households could select schools with 1 s.d. worth of additional value added. This may reflect that households have incorrect beliefs about schoolsâ€™ value added, or that their preferences lead them to prioritize other school traits. We elicit householdsâ€™ beliefs and find that they explain less than a fifth of the variation in value added. We then inform randomly selected households about the value added of the schools in their towns. This improves the accuracy of householdsâ€™ beliefs and leads low-achieving students to attend higher-value added schools. We next estimate householdsâ€™ preferences and predict their choices under the counterfactual of fully accurate beliefs. We find that beliefs account for 18 (11) percent of the value added that households with low- (high-) achieving children leave unexploited. Interestingly, for households with low-achieving children, the experiment seems to have affected both beliefs and preferences. This generates larger effects on choices than would be predicted via impacts on beliefs alone.},

Despite widespread recognition of this crisis, there is remarkably little analytical work on how the Indian state works, particularly at the level of implementation. We know very little about the everyday practices of local bureaucrats, the decision-making systems within which they function and the organizational culture and norms that this fosters. Such an understanding is critical both to unpacking the roots of this implementation failure as well as to understanding how reform efforts are institutionalized, interpreted and implemented on the ground. Crucially, it can offer insights into understanding why the implementation crisis persists and under what conditions this can be reversed.},

  abstract = {There are a wide variety of development interventions that have been shown to improve welfare of poor, rural households. However, these are normally delivered piecemeal. Using a randomized controlled trial, we test a new model of aid delivery called the Human Development Fund (HDF) in which a bundle of promising income-generating goods (such as fertilizer and hybrid chickens) and preventative health products (such as insecticide-treated bednets and corn-soy nutritional powder) are given to rural households in Tanzania using a low-cost one-time distribution system. We find large and positive effects of the HDF program on income and household consumption. Net income derived from maize, chickens, and energy increases by 144 USD, resulting in a tripling of total net income in these categories, and a 35\% return on the cost of the income-generating assets of HDF. Household consumption also increases by 6.1\% in the year following the HDF bundle distribution. However, the vast majority of the income increase is driven by maize profits, with the other income-generating goods (hybrid chickens and solar lamps) yielding disappointing results. Therefore, it likely would have been more cost-effective to simply distribute improved maize inputs in the study region, potentially along with one or more health products with potential to lead to longer term welfare gains.},

In the process, they have provided some of the most credible observational evidence in support of the hypothesis. The magnitude of the impacts is generally large. Thus, the fetal origins hypothesis has not only survived contact with economics, but has flourished.},

We report excess mortality estimates from three different data sources from the pandemicâ€™s start through June 2021. First, extrapolation of state-level civil registration from seven states suggests 3.4 million excess deaths. Second, applying international estimates of age-specific infection fatality rates (IFR) to Indian seroprevalence data implies a higher toll of around 4 million. Third, our analysis of the Consumer Pyramid Household Survey, a longitudinal panel of over 800,000 individuals across all states, yields an estimate of 4.9 million excess deaths. Each of these estimates has shortcomings and they also diverge in the pattern of deaths between the two waves of the pandemic. Estimating COVID-deaths with statistical confidence may prove elusive. But all estimates suggest that the death toll from the pandemic is likely to be an order of magnitude greater than the official count of 400,000; they also suggest that the first wave was more lethal than is believed. Understanding and engaging with the data-based estimates is necessary because in this horrific tragedy the countingâ€”and the attendant accountabilityâ€”will count for now but also the future.},

Using new data, we document the phenomenal rise of the private sector in Pakistan and show that an increasing segment of children enrolled in private schools are from rural areas and from middle-class and poorer families. The key element in their rise is their low fees-- the average fee of a rural private school in Pakistan is less than a dime a day (Rs.6)! They hire predominantly local, female and moderately educated teachers who have limited alternative opportunities outside the village. Hiring these teachers at low cost allows the savings to be passed on to parents through very low fees. This mechanismâ€”the need to hire teachers with a certain demographic profile so that salary costs are minimizedâ€”defines the possibility of private schoolsâ€”where they arise, fees are low. It also defines their limits. Private schools are horizontally constrained in that they arise in villages where there is a pool of secondaryeducated women. They are also vertically constrained in that they are unlikely to cater to the secondary levels in rural areas, at least until there is an increase in the supply of potential teachers with the required skills and educational levels.},

Many of these interventions have limited impact, however; schools get built but children don't learn, IT systems are introduced but not used, plans are written but not implemented. These achievement deficiencies reveal gaps in capabilities, and weaknesses in the process of building state capability. 00This book addresses these weaknesses and gaps. It starts by providing evidence of the capability shortfalls that currently exist in many countries, showing that many governments lack basic capacities even after decades of reforms and capacity building efforts. The book then analyses this evidence, identifying capability traps that hold many governments back - particularly related to isomorphic mimicry (where governments copy best practice solutions from other countries that make them look more capable even if they are not more capable) and premature load bearing (where governments adopt new mechanisms that they cannot actually make work, given weak extant capacities). The book then describes a process that governments can use to escape these capability traps.},

A large literature in econometrics develops procedures for detecting weak instruments and constructing robust confidence sets, but many of the results in this literature are limited to settings with independent and homoskedastic data, while data encountered in practice frequently violate these assumptions. We review the literature on weak instruments in linear IV regression with an emphasis on results for non-homoskedastic (heteroskedastic, serially correlated, or clustered) data. To assess the practical importance of weak instruments, we also report tabulations and simulations based on a survey of papers published in the American Economic Review from 2014 to 2018 that use instrumental variables. These results suggest that weak instruments remain an important issue for empirical practice, and that there are simple steps researchers can take to better handle weak instruments in applications.},

While some studies measure student involvement in educational activities during the crisis through phone-based surveys, the literature on assessing learning by phone is almost nonexistent, despite the fact that learning loss has major implications for school dropout and rising inequality. In this article, we draw on our pilot testing of phone-based assessments in Botswana, along with the existing literature on oral testing of reading and mathematics, to propose a series of preliminary principles to guide researchers and service providers as they try phone-based learning assessments. We provide guidance to help teams (1) ensure that children are not put at risk, (2) test the reliability and validity of phone-based measures, (3) use simple instructions and practice items to ensure the assessment is focused on the target skill, not general language and test-taking skills, (4) adapt the items from oral assessments that will be most effective in phone-based assessments, (5) keep assessments brief while still gathering meaningful learning data, (6) learn from the speed and confidence of responses, (7) use effective strategies to encourage respondents to pick up the phone, and (8) build rapport with adult caregivers and youth respondents.},

We introduce two simple empirical strategies to harness this randomization for value-added models (VAMs) measuring the causal effects of individual schools. The first estimator controls for the probability of being offered admission to different schools, treating the take-up decision as independent of potential outcomes. Randomness in school assignments is used to test this key conditional independence assumption. The second estimator uses randomness in offers to generate instrumental variables (IVs) for school enrollment. This procedure uses a low-dimensional model of school quality mediators to solve the under-identification challenge arising from the fact that some schools are under-subscribed. Both approaches relax the assumptions of conventional value-added models while obviating the need for elaborate nonlinear estimators. In applications to data from Denver and New York City, we find that models controlling for both assignment risk and lagged achievement yield highly reliable VAM estimates.

  abstract = {An instrumental variables (IV) identification strategy that exploits statutory class size caps shows significant achievement gains in smaller classes in Italian primary schools. Gains from small classes are driven mainly by schools in Southern Italy, suggesting a substantial return to class size reductions for residents of the Mezzogiorno. In addition to high unemployment and other social problems, however, the Mezzogiorno is distinguished by pervasive manipulation of standardized test scores, a finding revealed in a natural experiment that randomly assigned school monitors. IV estimates also show that small classes increase score manipulation. Estimates of a causal model for achievement with two endogenous variables, class size and score manipulation, suggest that the effects of class size on measured achievement are driven entirely by the relationship between class size and manipulation. Dishonest scoring appears to be a consequence of teacher shirking more than teacher cheating. These findings show how consequential score manipulation can arise even in assessment systems with few NCLB-style accountability concerns.},

  abstract = {Colombia's PACES program provided over 125,000 pupils from poor neighborhoods with vouchers that covered approximately half the cost of private secondary school. Since many vouchers were allocated by lottery, we use differences in outcomes between lottery winners and losers to assess program effects. Three years into the program, lottery winners were 15 percentage points more likely to have attended private school, had completed .1 more years of schooling, and were about 10 percentage points more likely to have finished 8 th grade, primarily because they were less likely to repeat grades. The program did not significantly affect dropout rates. Lottery winners scored .2 standard deviations higher on standardized tests. There is some evidence that winners worked less than losers and were less likely to marry or cohabit as teenagers. On average, lottery winners increased their educational expenditure by about 70\% of the value of the voucher. Since winners also worked less, they devoted more total resources to education. Compared to an equivalent expansion of the public education system, the voucher program increased annual government educational expenditure by about \$24 per winner. But the costs to the government and to participants were probably much less than the increase in winners' earnings due to greater educational attainment.},

We examine why school systems varied between countries and over time, concentrating on three institutional dimensions: centralization, secularization, and subsidization. There were two paths to centralization: through liberal and social democratic governments in democracies, or through fascist and conservative parties in autocracies. We find that the secularization of public school systems can be explained by path-dependent state-church relationships (countries with established national churches were less likely to have secularized education systems) but also by partisan politics. Finally, we find that the provision of public funding to private providers of education, especially to private religious schools, can be seen as a solution to religious conflict, since such institutions were most common in countries where Catholicism was a significant but not entirely dominant religion.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on public sector management reform â€˜best-practiceâ€™ case experience from Sub-Sahara African (SSA). Given that â€˜best-practiceâ€™ is a relative concept and often debatable, the paper uses the Ghana Civil Service Performance Improvement Programme (GCSPIP) experience as rather a â€˜good-practiceâ€™ case with the view to sharing the outcome and lessons to encourage collaborative-learning. It seeks to share the outcome and lessons learnt by the Ghana civil service reform with future public service reformers and to contribute to the literature. The paper concludes with an adaptable three-dimensional framework. The framework argues that successful future public service reform (PSR) should consider three broad issues: first, are the â€˜critical success factorsâ€™, including wholehearted political leadership commitment; wholehearted bureaucratic leadership commitment; thoughtful synergistic planning/preparation; patience for implementation and evaluation; capacity to convince; neutralise and accommodate reform-phobias and critics; sustainable financial and technical resource availability and conscious nurturing of general public support. Second, is the need for reformers to appreciate the concerns of the public and the civil society scepticism of public â€˜institutionsâ€™ and its â€˜operativesâ€™ and finally placing any reform programme in a country-specific context, including understanding its history, culture, politics, economy, sociology, ideology and values.

In the first step of the research design, we develop an empirical model of school choice subject to liquidity and credit constraints that is estimated using data from only the control markets. Based on this exercise, we estimate that the voucher generated welfare gains exceeding four times the average private school's annual tuition on average to the students induced into private schooling. The second step of the research design will validate the estimated welfare impacts by comparing model predictions for a simulated voucher program in control markets with the data from the treatment group. The results in this paper are based on the first step (using only control data) and this draft serves as a pre-commitment to the model estimates and predictions before examining the experimental data.},

This perspective suggests a generalization with two way (both unit and time) fixed effects, and both unit and time weights, which can be interpreted as a unit and time weighted version of the standard Difference In Differences (DID) estimator. We find that this new Synthetic Difference In Differences (SDID) estimator has attractive properties compared to the SC and DID estimators. Formally we show that our approach has double robustness properties: the SDID estimator is consistent under a wide variety of weighting schemes given a well-specified fixed effects model, and SDID is consistent with appropriately penalized SC weights when the basic fixed effects model is misspecified and instead the true data generating process involves a more general low-rank structure (e.g., a latent factor model). We also present results that justify standard inference based on weighted DID regression. Further generalizations include unit and time weighted factor models.},

While a pedagogy based on rote learning of facts is often cited as a factor for limited school effectiveness, evidence of success of introducing new pedagogies to teachers is scarce. Indeed, most in-service teacher interventions evaluated in the literature have been ineffective. In this paper, we report on the randomized evaluation in Uganda of an intervention in which teachers were trained in a â€œlearning how to learnâ€ approach. The curriculum, called Preparation for Social Action, trained teachers to teach students to learn like scientists: posing sharp questions, framing specific hypotheses, using evidence and data gathered from everyday life whenever possible. We find evidence that the approach was adopted in class, with dramatic effects on learning: The intervention raised the pass rate in the national exam that determines progression from elementary to secondary school from 51\% to 75\%, which places the program in the top five percentile of all rigorously evaluated education interventions in terms of learning-adjusted years of schooling.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study methods for estimating causal effects in settings with panel data, where a subset of units are exposed to a treatment during a subset of periods, and the goal is estimating counterfactual (untreated) outcomes for the treated unit/period combinations. We develop a class of matrix completion estimators that uses the observed elements of the matrix of control outcomes corresponding to untreated unit/periods to predict the â€œmissingâ€ elements of the matrix, corresponding to treated units/periods. The approach estimates a matrix that well-approximates the original (incomplete) matrix, but has lower complexity according to the nuclear norm for matrices. From a technical perspective, we generalize results from the matrix completion literature by allowing the patterns of missing data to have a time series dependency structure. We also present novel insights concerning the connections between the matrix completion literature, the literature on interactive fixed effects models and the literatures on program evaluation under unconfoundedness and synthetic control methods.},

We show the usefulness of using experimental data to estimate a structural economic model as well as the importance of a structural model in interpreting experimental results. The availability of the experiment also allows us to estimate the programâ€™s general equilibrium effects, which we then incorporate into our simulations. Our main findings are (i) the programâ€™s grant has a much stronger impact on school enrolment than an equivalent reduction in child wages; (ii) the program has a positive effect on the enrollment of children, especially after primary school; this result is well replicated by the parsimonious structural model; (iii) there are sizeable effects of the program on child wages, which, however, reduce the effectiveness of the program only marginally; and (iv) a revenue neutral change in the program that would increase the grant for secondary school children while eliminating for the primary school children would have a substantially larger effect on enrollment of the latter, while having minor effects on the former.},

We control for prior achievement at the secondary level (at the end of tenth-grade) to estimate the value added of a teacher over a two year course, and define a good teacher as one who consistently gets higher achievement for students. In addition to the prior achievement, we exploit the fact that students took exams in multiple subjects during their senior secondary exam to control for pupil fixed effects. We find a considerable variability in teacher effectiveness over a two year course â€“ a one standard deviation improvement in teacher quality adds 0.38 standard deviation points in students score. Furthermore, consistent with studies in the US, we find that although teacher quality matters, the observed characteristics explain little of the variability in teacher quality.},

Although all three types of measures could be biased by unmeasured traits of the students in teachersâ€™ classrooms, prior research has largely focused on the validity of value-added measures. We conduct an experiment involving 66 mathematics teachers in four school districts and test the validity of all three types of measures. Specifically, we test whether a teacherâ€™s performance on each measure under naturally occurring (i.e., non-experimental) settings predicts performance following random assignment of that teacher to a class of students. Combining our results with those from two previous experiments, we provide further evidence that value-added measures are unbiased predictors of teacher performance. In addition, we provide the first evidence that classroom observation scores are unbiased predictors of teacher performance on a rubric measuring the quality of mathematics instruction. Unfortunately, we lack the statistical power to reach any similar conclusions regarding the predictive validity of a teacherâ€™s student survey responses.},

They conclude that there is little to no bias in their estimates. Using the same model with data from North Carolina, Rothstein (2014) argued that the CFR research design is invalid, given a relationship between student baseline test scores and teachers' value-added. In this paper, we replicated the CFR analysis using data from the Los Angeles Unified School District and similarly found that teacher value-added estimates were valid predictors of student achievement. We also demonstrate that Rothstein's test does not invalidate the CFR design and instead reflects a mechanical relationship, given that teacher value-added scores from prior years and baseline test scores can be based on the same data. In addition, we explore the (1) predictive validity of value-added estimates drawn from the same, similar, and different schools, (2) an alternative way of estimating differences in access to effective teaching by taking teacher experience into account, and (3) the implications of alternative ways of imputing value-added when it cannot be estimated directly.},

At the same time, it is common to find that the effects of life events or interventions diminish and even disappear completely, a phenomenon known as fadeout. We review the evidence for persistence and fadeout, drawing primarily on evidence from educational interventions. We conclude that 1) fadeout is widespread, and often co-exists with persistence; 2) fadeout is a substantive phenomenon, not merely a measurement artefact; and 3) persistence depends on the types of skills targeted, the institutional constraints and opportunities within the social context, and complementarities between interventions and subsequent environmental affordances. We discuss the implications of these conclusions for research and policy.},

  abstract = {We evaluate a large-scale set of interventions to increase demand for immunization in Haryana, India. The policies under consideration include the two most frequently discussed toolsâ€”reminders and incentivesâ€”as well as an intervention inspired by the networks literature. We cross-randomize whether (a) individuals receive SMS reminders about upcoming vaccination drives; (b) individuals receive incentives for vaccinating their children; (c) influential individuals (information hubs, trusted individuals, or both) are asked to act as â€œambassadorsâ€ receiving regular reminders to spread the word about immunization in their community. By taking into account different versions (or â€œdosagesâ€) of each intervention, we obtain 75 unique policy combinations. We develop a new statistical techniqueâ€”a smart pooling and pruning procedureâ€”for finding a best policy from a large set, which also determines which policies are effective and the effect of the best policy. We proceed in two steps. First, we use a LASSO technique to collapse the data: we pool dosages of the same treatment if the data cannot reject that they had the same impact, and prune policies deemed ineffective. Second, using the remaining (pooled) policies, we estimate the effect of the best policy, accounting for the winnerâ€™s curse. The key outcomes are (i) the number of measles immunizations and (ii) the number of immunizations per dollar spent. The policy that has the largest impact (information hubs, SMS reminders, incentives that increase with each immunization) increases the number of immunizations by 44 \% relative to the status quo. The most cost-effective policy (information hubs, SMS reminders, no incentives) increases the number of immunizations per dollar by 9.1\%.},

This method is particularly appropriate for children who have been in school for a few years but for various reasons have not acquired foundational skills. The evolution of this approach has occurred over a period of almost two decades. The story of how this approach was developed provides a fascinating case of how innovative interventions and rigorous evidence can go hand in hand. Today TaRL is one of the most effective ways to improve childrenâ€™s learning. It has been used widely in India and now increasingly is being tried in sub Saharan Africa. This contribution outlines main milestones of this joint journey and discusses what made this evolution effective.},

  author = {Bano, Masooda and Oberoi, Zeena},
  pages = {23},
  abstract = {The learning crisis in many developing countries has led to searches for innovative teaching models. Adoption of innovation, however, disrupts routine and breaks institutional inertia, requiring government employees to change their way of working. Introducing and embedding innovative methods for improving learning outcomes within state institutions is thus a major challenge. For NGO-led innovation to have largescale impact, we need to understand: (1) what factors facilitate its adoption by senior bureaucracy and political elites; and (2) how to incentivise district-level field staff and school principals and teachers, who have to change their ways of working, to implement the innovation? This paper presents an ethnographic study of Pratham, one of the most influential NGOs in the domain of education in India today, which has attracted growing attention for introducing an innovative teaching methodologyâ€” Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) â€“ with evidence of improved learning outcomes among primary-school students and adoption by a number of states in India. The case study suggests that while a combination of factors, including evidence of success, ease of method, the presence of a committed bureaucrat, and political opportunity are key to state adoption of an innovation, exposure to ground realities, hand holding and confidence building, informal interactions, provision of new teaching resources, and using existing lines of communication are core to ensuring the co-operation of those responsible for actual implementation. The Pratham case, however, also confirms existing concerns that even when NGO-led innovations are successfully implemented at a large scale, their replication across the state and their sustainability remain a challenge. Embedding good practice takes time; the political commitment leading to adoption of an innovation is often, however, tied to an immediate political opportunity being exploited by the political elites. Thus, when political opportunity rather than a genuine political will creates space for adoption of an innovation, state support for that innovation fades away before the new ways of working can replace the old habits. In contexts where states lack political will to improve learning outcomes, NGOs can only hope to make systematic change in state systems if, as in the case of Pratham, they operate as semi-social movements with large cadres of volunteers. The network of volunteers enables them to slow down and pick up again in response to changing political contexts, instead of quitting when state actors withdraw. Involving the community itself does not automatically lead to greater political accountability. Time-bound donor-funded NGO projects aiming to introduce innovation, however large in scale, simply cannot succeed in bringing about systematic change, because embedding change in state institutions lacking political will requires years of sustained engagement.},

  abstract = {Objective To assess the efficacy of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) against malaria in school-aged children. Methods This was an open randomized controlled trial of seasonal IPT among school children (IPTsc) aged 6â€“13 years in KollÃ©, Mali. The study began in September 2007 and completed follow-up in May 2008. Students were randomized to one of three study arms: Sulfadoxineâ€“pyrimethamine plus artesunate (SP/AS), amodiaquine plus artesunate (AQ/AS) or vitamin C. All students received two full treatment doses, given 2 months apart during the season of high transmission from September to December. Groups were compared with respect to incidence of clinical malaria, asymptomatic parasitemia and haemoglobin concentration. Results A total of 296 students were randomized, and retention in the study was 99.3\%. Clinical malaria incidence in the SP/AS and AQ/AS arms was reduced by 66.6\% and 46.5\%, respectively, vs. vitamin C (P {$<$} 0.001). There were fewer clinic visits for any cause among the children receiving SP/AS or AQ/AS (P = 0.024). The prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia was fivefold higher in the vitamin C arm than either SP/AS or AQ/AS at each post-treatment evaluation (P {$<$} 0.001). At the end of the transmission period, children treated with IPT had lower rates of anaemia (SP/AS, 17.7\%; AQ/AS, 16.0\%; vitamin C, 29.6\%; P = 0.039). Conclusion IPT among school children reduced the rates of clinical malaria, all-cause acute clinic visits, asymptomatic parasitemia and anaemia among school-aged children.},

Yet, in many low-income countries, children and their parents face tradeoffs between schooling and productive work. If there are positive returns to human capital in child labor, then children who receive greater early life investments may attend less school. Exploiting early life rainfall shocks in India as a source of exogenous variation in early life investment, we show that increased early life investment reduces schooling in districts with high child labor, especially for girls and lower castes. These effects persist and are intergenerational, affecting fertility, per capita household consumption, and other measures of household poverty, and lead to a divergence in the next generations' educational outcomes. Our results are robust to the inclusion of rich controls for district-level characteristics and an IV strategy. We provide evidence that reductions in educational investment in response to positive early life shocks are inefficient.},

I develop and estimate an equilibrium model of school competition in Pakistan, a country with a large private schooling market. The estimates show that match-specific quality matters: moving a student from her worst to best possible match school increases test scores by 0.3 s.d. Profit-maximizing private schools choose their match-specific quality in response to the marginal rather than the average student. Since rich students are more responsive to quality when they make enrollment decisions, the average private school chooses a match-specific quality that advantages rich students at the expense of poor students. From the point of view of maximizing learning, match-specific quality is significantly misallocated. The entry of an additional private school exacerbates the incentive to cater to wealthy students, increasing inequality within private schools by 0.1 s.d.},

Although effective teachers increase learning substantially, observed teacher characteristics account for less than 5 percent of the variation in TVA. The first two years on the job, as well as content knowledge, are the two robust correlates of TVA in our sample. Wages for public sector teachers are not correlated with TVA, although they are in the private sector. Finally, hiring contract teachers with 35 percent lower wages has no discernible effect on the quality of entrants into the teaching workforce.},

The program targeted children with low socioeconomic status who had limited access to formal preschool education. The program was screened for a period of 13 weeks and was evaluated with an experimental design, with the addition of a natural observation group. Findings indicated that the program functioned as an early educational intervention for those children who had moderate exposure to it. Furthermore, compensatory effects were found, such that those children who had low levels of skills prior to the viewing of the program benefited more than their skilled peers. The policy implications are important for enhancing school readiness among children in socioeconomically deprived contexts.},

To minimize the effect of distributional assumptions, program impacts are estimated as nonparametric functions of age and duration. A generalized matching estimator is developed and used to control for nonrandom selectivity into the program and into exposure durations. Comparisons with three groupsâ€”children in the feeder area not in the program, children in the program for Õ…1 month, and children living in similar areas without the programâ€”indicate that estimates are robust for significant positive effects of the program on cognitive and psychosocial outcomes with Õ†7 monthsâ€™ exposure, although the age patterns of effects differ slightly by comparison group.},

A randomized experiment based around the introduction of the entreprenant legal status in Benin is used to test these assumptions, along with supplementary efforts to enhance the presumed benefits of formalizing to firms. Few firms register when just given information about the new regime, but our full package of supplementary efforts boosts formalization by 16.3 percentage points. However, this formalization does not bring firms higher sales or profits, and the cost of formalizing these firms exceeds the added taxation they will pay over the next decade. We show how better targeting of these policies towards firms that look more like formal firms to begin with can increase the formalization rate and improve costeffectiveness.},

However, it is difficult to prevent cheating if it is widespread. We evaluate the impact of computer-based testing (CBT) on national exam scores in junior secondary schools in Indonesia, exploiting the phased roll-out of the program from 2015 to 2019. First, we find that test scores decline dramatically after the introduction of CBT with school-level means declining by 0.4 standard deviation. Schools with response patterns that indicate cheating experience an increased drop in their test scores. Second, scores rebound within two years after introducing CBT, suggesting that barriers to cheating provide incentives for learning. Third, we find evidence of spillover effects from CBT within districts. Cheating declines more in schools that have not yet switched to CBT if more schools located in the same districts make the switch, suggesting that CBT not only eliminates cheating but makes it less socially permissible.},

  abstract = {In developing countries, a common approach to encourage education is to provide cash incentives to households conditional on their childrenâ€™s enrollment, attendance or achievement in school. Little is known, however, about whether the identity of recipientâ€” either the parent or childâ€” can inâ€¡uence the eÂ¤ectiveness of these interventions. This study provides an empirical test of whether changing the recipient of the incentive aÂ¤ects outcomes. To structure the test, I develop a model of household education production in which parentsâ€™ability to motivate their children is dampened because of moral hazard. In the model, when parental inputs are more productive, rewarding parents is more eÂ¤ective than rewarding children, while the opposite is true when child inputs are more productive. A testable prediction is that the relative eÂ¤ectiveness of rewarding the parent rather than the child should be positively correlated with the part of the childâ€™s prior achievement that is predicted by parental characteristics. I test the model with a â€¦eld experiment in Gurgaon, India where an incentive to achieve a speciâ€¦c reading goal was randomly assigned to be received by either the parent or by the child. I â€¦nd that incentives to parents result in worse outcomes than incentives to children when children have less productive parents and lower initial test scores. Conversely, incentives to parents result in better outcomes when children have more productive parents and higher initial test scores.},

  abstract = {Experimental studies rarely consider the shape and nature of the education production function, which is useful for deriving optimal levels of input substitution in increasingly resource constrained environments. Because of the rapid expansion of EdTech as a substitute for traditional learning around the world and against the backdrop of full-scale temporary substitution due to the coronavirus pandemic, we explore the educational production function by using a large randomized controlled trial that varies dosage of computer-assisted learning (CAL) as a substitute for traditional learning. Results show production is concave in CAL. Moving from zero to a low level of CAL, the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) of CAL for traditional learning is greater than one. Moving from a lower to a higher level of CAL, production remains on the same or a lower isoquant and the MRTS is equal to or less than one. The estimates are consistent with the general form of a Cobb-Douglas production function and imply that a blended approach of CAL and traditional learning is optimal. The findings have direct implications for the rapidly expanding use of educational technology worldwide and its continued substitution for traditional learning.},

We use the idea that medical treatments often follow rules of thumb for assigning care to patients, such as the classification of Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW), which assigns infants special care at a specific birth weight cutoff. Using detailed administrative data on schooling and birth records from Chile and Norway, we establish that children who receive extra medical care at birth have lower mortality rates and higher test scores and grades in school. These gains are in the order of 0.15-0.22 standard deviations.},

This brief argues that the RTE Act must now move beyond â€œeasy to measureâ€ metrics and focus on the quality of learning. Moreover, since states across India have varying requirements, the law must work towards increasing the scope for decentralisation. The brief takes stock of the RTE Actâ€™s successes, while highlighting the challenges that confront it: streamlining the 25-percent reservation system; the implementation of the no-detention policy; the unreasonably stringent input norms; and the need to include early childhood care and education within the ambit of the Act. The brief also provides recommendationsâ€”both at the systemic and policy levelsâ€”on how to address these challenges in the next iteration of the Act.},

This brief aims to demonstrate how the reliance on a simplistic metric of a 101point (0 100) scale for awarding absolute scores in each subject has resulted in a nearcomplete breakdown of the assessment standards in Indian board examinations, largely because of the existence of multiple systems. The boards are competing to stay relevant by awarding increasingly high scores, thus diluting academic standards and pulling down the public's trust in the assessment system.},

Prompted by this finding, many states and school districts have adopted valueadded measures as indicators of teacher job performance. In this paper, we conduct a new test of the validity of value-added models. Using administrative student data from New York City, we apply commonly estimated value-added models to an outcome teachers cannot plausibly affect: student height. We find the standard deviation of teacher effects on height is nearly as large as that for math and reading achievement, raising obvious questions about validity. Subsequent analysis finds these â€œeffectsâ€ are largely spurious variation (noise), rather than bias resulting from sorting on unobserved factors related to achievement. Given the difficulty of differentiating signal from noise in real-world teacher effect estimates, this paper serves as a cautionary tale for their use in practice.},

The campaigns began because of advances in health technology, which mitigates concerns about reverse causality. Malarious areas saw large drops in the disease thereafter. Relative to non-malarious areas, cohorts born after eradication had higher income as adults than the preceding generation. These cross-cohort changes coincided with childhood exposure to the campaigns rather than to pre-existing trends. Estimates suggest a substantial, though not predominant, role for malaria in explaining cross-region differences in income. (JEL I12, I18, J13, O15)},

  abstract = {What constraints arise when translating successful NGO programs to improve public services in developing countries into government policy? We report on a randomized trial embedded within a nationwide reform of teacher hiring in Kenyan government primary schools. New teachers offered a fixed-term contract by an international NGO significantly raised student test scores, while teachers offered identical contracts by the Kenyan government produced zero impact. Observable differences in teacher characteristics explain little of this gap. Instead, data suggests that bureaucratic and political opposition to the contract reform led to implementation delays and a differential interpretation of identical contract terms. Additionally, contract features that produced larger learning gains in both the NGO and government treatment arms were not adopted by the government outside of the experimental sample.},

Plausible transformations reverse the growth of the gap in the CNLSY and greatly reduce it in the ECLS-K during the early school years. All growth from entry through first grade and a nontrivial proportion from first to third grade probably reflects scaling decisions.},

We test whether norms shape the aggregate labor supply curve by leading decentralized individuals to maintain wage floors in their local labor markets. We partner with existing employers who create new jobs for workers in informal spot labor markets. Unemployed workers would like to find work, and prefer to do so even at wages below the prevailing wage rather than remain unemployed. However, they rarely do so when this choice is observable to other workers. In contrast, social observability does not affect labor supply at the prevailing wage. Consistent with the idea that norms could have aggregate implications, measures of social cohesion correlate with downward wage rigidity and business cycle volatility across India.},

  abstract = {We study the effects of news coverage of the novel coronavirus by the two most widely-viewed cable news shows in the United States â€” Hannity and Tucker Carlson Tonight, both on Fox News â€” on viewersâ€™ behavior and downstream health outcomes. Carlson warned viewers about the threat posed by the coronavirus from early February, while Hannity originally dismissed the risks associated with the virus before gradually adjusting his position starting late February. We first validate these differences in content with independent coding of show transcripts. In line with the differences in content, we present novel survey evidence that Hannityâ€™s viewers changed behavior in response to the virus later than other Fox News viewers, while Carlsonâ€™s viewers changed behavior earlier. We then turn to the effects on the pandemic itself, examining health outcomes across counties. First, we document that greater viewership of Hannity relative to Tucker Carlson Tonight is strongly associated with a greater number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the early stages of the pandemic. The relationship is stable across an expansive set of robustness tests. To better identify the effect of differential viewership of the two shows, we employ a novel instrumental variable strategy exploiting variation in when shows are broadcast in relation to local sunset times. These estimates also show that greater exposure to Hannity relative to Tucker Carlson Tonight is associated with a greater number of county-level cases and deaths. Furthermore, the results suggest that in mid-March, after Hannityâ€™s shift in tone, the diverging trajectories on COVID-19 cases begin to revert. We provide additional evidence consistent with misinformation being an important mechanism driving the effects in the data. While our findings cannot yet speak to long-term effects, they indicate that provision of misinformation in the early stages of a pandemic can have important consequences for how a disease ultimately affects the population.},

  abstract = {The emergence of new information and communication technologies in the 1990s offered governments opportunities to deliver public services more effectively to their citizens. Yet national and subnational authorities have employed such technologies in highly uneven ways. Drawing on a new data set of technology policy adoption by Indian states, the author argues that political calculations drive variation in the timing and scope of technology policies. Politicians weigh the expected electoral benefits from providing new goods to citizens against the expected electoral costs of reduced access to corrupt funds because of increased transparency.The author shows that the level of bureaucratic corruption in a state is the best predictor of both when states implement policies promoting computer-enabled services and the number of services made available.This finding contrasts with arguments that posit economic or developmental conditions, or alternative electoral and institutional characteristics, as the major drivers of technology investment.},

Following the results in Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014a, Working paper, University of Michigan), we also introduce rdplot, a command that implements several data-driven choices of the number of bins in evenly spaced and quantile-spaced partitions that are used to construct the RD plots usually encountered in empirical applications.

I focus on four areas of work: theoretical and econometric advances in modelling the causal effect of education in the presence of heterogeneous returns to schooling; recent studies that use institutional aspects of the education system to form instrnmental variables estimates of the return to schooling; recent studies of the earnings and schooling of twins; and recent attempts to explicitly model sources of heterogeneity in the returns to education. Consistent with earlier surveys of the literature, I conclude that the average (or average marginal) return to education is not much below the estimate that emerges from a standard human capital earnings function fit by OLS. Evidence from the latest studies of identical twins suggests a small upward "ability" bias - on the order of 10\%. A consistent finding among studies using instrnmental variables based on institutional changes in the education system is that the estimated returns to schooling are 20-40\% above the corresponding OLS estimates. Part of the explanation for this finding may be that marginal returns to schooling for certain subgroups - particularly relatively disadvantaged groups with low education outcomes - are higher than the average marginal returns to education in the population as a whole.

A simple theoretical model that highlights the role of comparative advantage in the optimal schooling decision is presented and used to motivate an extended discussion of econometric issues, including the properties of ordinary least squares and instrumental variables estimators. A review of studies that have used compulsory schooling laws, differences in the accessibility of schools, and similar features as instrumental variables for completed education, reveals that the resulting estimates of the return to schooling are typically as big or bigger than the corresponding ordinary least squares estimates. One interpretation of this finding is that marginal returns to education among the low-education subgroups typically affected by supply-side innovations tend to be relatively high, reflecting their high marginal costs of schooling, rather than low ability that limits their return to education.},

This paper studies the demand for school attributes in Pakistan, by estimating a standard model of demand for differentiated products to a dataset with information on school characteristics, school costs, household and child characteristics, and school choices. Parents have strong preferences for school attributes such as school facilities, the gender of the teacher, and most importantly, distance to oneâ€™s residence. A 500 meter reduction in distance to school is worth two thirds of the average annual school fee for girls, and the total annual school fee for boys (about USD\$13). Parents do not appear to value the average test scores of either the students or the teachers in the school, perhaps because they are hard to observe. Our estimates imply that, on average, girls benefited more than boys from the increased trend in private schools.},

These four countries encompassed more than 50\% of the world's population in 1910, but remarkably few of their citizens attended any school by the early 20th century. We present new, comparable data on school inputs and outputs for BRIC drawn from contemporary surveys and government documents. Recent studies emphasize the importance of political decentralization, and relatively broad political voice for the early spread of public primary education in developed economies. We identify the former and the lack of the latter to be important in the context of BRIC, but we also outline how other factors such as factor endowments, colonialism, serfdom, and, especially, the characteristics of the political and economic elite help explain the low achievement levels of these four countries and the incredible amount of heterogeneity within each of them.},

Although public and private funds were used to expand and improve the public education system, there were fewer than 3 primary schools for every 10 villages as late as 1911. To explore the impact of the funding system on the provision of schools, I empirically analyze the links between local factors and schooling using a new historical dataset. I find that districts with higher levels of caste and religious diversity had fewer privately managed primary schools and fewer total primary schools. Heterogeneous preferences across groups, unequal political power in more diverse districts and low demand for education by lower castes are all potential explanations for this pattern. Broadly, the results highlight the challenges involved in the provision of primary education in the presence of numerous and perhaps unequal groups.},

However, studies utilizing short-term fluctuations in pollution may detect mortality changes among the already ill or dying, while prospective cohort studies, which utilize geographic differences in long-run pollution levels, may suffer from severe omitted variables bias. This study utilizes the long-run reduction in total suspended particulates (TSPs) pollution induced by the Clean Air Act of 1970, which mandated aggressive regulation of local polluters in heavily polluted counties. We find that regulatory status is associated with large reductions in TSPs pollution but has little association with reductions in either adult or elderly mortality. These findings are interpreted with caution due to several caveats.},

By constructing scenarios with different combinations of NPIs, our empirical findings suggest that countries may avoid the lockdown policy with imposing school closure, mask wearing and centralized quarantine to reach similar outcomes on controlling the COVID-19 infection. Our results also suggest that, as of April 4th, 2020, certain countries such as the U.S. and Singapore may require additional measures of NPIs in order to control disease transmissions more effectively, while other countries may cautiously consider to gradually lift some NPIs to mitigate the costs to the overall economy.},

We report daily statistics on consumer spending, business revenues, employment rates, and other key indicators disaggregated by ZIP code, industry, income group, and business size. Using these data, we study the mechanisms through which COVID-19 affected the economy by analyzing heterogeneity in its impacts. We first show that high-income individuals reduced spending sharply in mid-March 2020, particularly in areas with high rates of COVID-19 infection and in sectors that require in-person interaction. This reduction in spending greatly reduced the revenues of businesses that cater to high-income households in person, notably small businesses in affluent ZIP codes. These businesses laid off many of their employees, leading to widespread job losses especially among low-wage workers in affluent areas. High-wage workers experienced a â€œV-shapedâ€ recession that lasted a few weeks in terms of employment loss, whereas low-wage workers experienced much larger job losses that persisted for several months. Building on this diagnostic analysis, we use event study designs to estimate the causal effects of policies aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of COVID-19. State-ordered reopenings of economies have small impacts on spending and employment. Stimulus payments to low-income households increased consumer spending sharply, but little of this increased spending flowed to businesses most affected by the COVID-19 shock, dampening its impacts on employment. Paycheck Protection Program loans increased employment at small businesses by only 3\%, implying a cost of \$290,000 per job saved. These results suggest that traditional macroeconomic tools â€“ stimulating aggregate demand or providing liquidity to businesses â€“ have diminished capacity to restore employment when consumer spending is constrained by health concerns. During a pandemic, it may be more fruitful to mitigate economic hardship through social insurance. More broadly, this analysis shows how public statistics constructed from private sector data can support many research and policy analyses without compromising privacy, providing a new tool for real time empirical macroeconomics.},

This paper evaluates the long-term impacts of STAR by linking the experimental data to administrative records. We first demonstrate that kindergarten test scores are highly correlated with outcomes such as earnings at age 27, college attendance, home ownership, and retirement savings. We then document four sets of experimental impacts. First, students in small classes are significantly more likely to attend college and exhibit improvements on other outcomes. Class size does not have a significant effect on earnings at age 27, but this effect is imprecisely estimated. Second, students who had a more experienced teacher in kindergarten have higher earnings. Third, an analysis of variance reveals significant classroom effects on earnings. Students who were randomly assigned to higher quality classrooms in grades K-3 â€“ as measured by classmates' end-of-class test scores â€“ have higher earnings, college attendance rates, and other outcomes. Finally, the effects of class quality fade out on test scores in later grades but gains in non-cognitive measures persist.},

This question has sparked debate partly because of a lack of evidence on whether high value-added (VA) teachers improve students' long-term outcomes. Using school district and tax records for more than one million children, we find that students assigned to high-VA teachers are more likely to attend college, earn higher salaries, and are less likely to have children as teenagers. Replacing a teacher whose VA is in the bottom 5 percent with an average teacher would increase the present value of students' lifetime income by approximately \$250,000 per classroom.

The central government paid for 140,000 teachers, which is 8\% of the pre-reform stock of primary-level teachers. I find that less than half of these teachers were sent to the intended place. Additionally, teachers per school did not increase and class size did not decrease. The only effect on school inputs appears to have been the redistribution of teachers from larger schools to smaller schools. This nevertheless generated increases in the primary school completion rate, especially for girls and the poor.},

Almost one in three children under age five is stunted, and the rate is significantly higher among children from low income households. The undernutrition challenge is likely to exacerbate with the economic shock and food insecurity that COVID-19 has brought. The countryâ€™s flagship safety net program, Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), has a great potential to improve nutrition outcomes of children living in poverty, by providing cash assistance conditional upon their health check-ups and growth monitoring and raising caregiverâ€™s knowledge and awareness on nutrition through family development sessions. There was strong evidence of the effectiveness of 4Ps on nutrition outcomes during the early stage of program implementation. Over time, however, 4Psâ€™ impact on nutrition faded for several reasons, most notably with the decreasing number of young children (who need nutrition the most) served by the program. This policy note proposes key areas where 4Ps can further strengthen to improve the nutrition outcomes among children in poor and vulnerable households.},

This study tests for both these using results from a randomized evaluation of two different forms of teacher professional development - Coaching or Training - aimed at improving teaching of early-grade reading in South Africa. We find that for both programs the initial improvements in learning persist, when students are assessed one year after the program ended. However, the impacts on the subsequent cohort of students â€“ i.e. those who were taught by teachers one year after they received coaching/training â€“ is roughly half the size and is only statistically significant for schools where teachers received Coaching. In both programs improvements in teacher knowledge and use of resources persisted up to three years after participating in the program, but only teachers who received Coaching maintain their improved teaching practices. These results demonstrate that resource-intensive programs that induce sustained changes in productivity can be more cost-effective in the long run due to benefits for future cohorts.},

  abstract = {Background\hspace{0.6em} School-aged children are rarely targeted by malaria control programmes, yet the prevalence of Plasmodium infection in primary school children often exceeds that seen in younger children and could affect haemoglobin concentration and school performance. Methods\hspace{0.6em} A cluster-randomised trial was carried out in 80 primary schools in southern Mali to evaluate the impact of a school-based malaria intervention package. Intervention schools received two interventions sequentially: (1) teacher-led participatory malaria prevention education, combined with distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), followed 7 months later at the end of the transmission season by (2) mass delivery of artesunate and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine administered by teachers, termed intermittent parasite clearance in schools (IPCs). Control schools received LLINs as part of the national universal net distribution programme. The impact of the interventions on malaria and anaemia was evaluated over 20 months using cross-sectional surveys in a random subset of 38 schools(all classes), with a range of cognitive measures (sustained attention, visual search, numeracy, vocabulary and writing) assessed in a longitudinal cohort of children aged 9â€“12 years in all 80 schools. Results\hspace{0.6em} Delivery of a single round of IPCs was associated with dramatic reductions in malaria parasitaemia (OR 0.005, 95\% CI 0.002 to 0.011, p{$<$}0.001) and gametocyte carriage (OR 0.02, 95\% CI 0.00 to 0.17, p{$<$}0.001) in intervention compared with control schools. This effect was sustained for 6 months until the beginning of the next transmission season. IPCs was also associated with a significant decrease in anaemia (OR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.40 to 0.78, p=0.001), and increase in sustained attention (difference +0.23, 95\% CI 0.10 to 0.36, p{$<$}0.001). There was no evidence of impact on other cognitive measures. Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} The combination of malaria prevention education, LLINs and IPCs can reduce anaemia and improve sustained attention of school children in areas of highly seasonal transmission. These findings highlight the impact of asymptomatic malaria infection on cognitive performance in schoolchildren and the benefit of IPCs in reducing this burden. Additionally, malaria control in},

Progress toward elimination may require effective targeting of specific human populations that act as key transmission reservoirs. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Parameterized using molecular-based Plasmodium falciparum infection data from cross-sectional community studies in southern Malawi, a simulation model was developed to predict the proportions of human-to-mosquito transmission arising from (a) children under 5 years old (U5s), (b) school-age children (SAC, 5â€“15 years), (c) young adults (16â€“30 years), and (d) adults {$>$}\,30 years. The model incorporates mosquito biting heterogeneity and differential infectivity (i.e. probability that a blood-fed mosquito develops oocysts) by age and gametocyte density. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The model predicted that SAC were responsible for more than 60\% of new mosquito infections in both dry and rainy seasons, even though they comprise only 30\% of this southern Malawi population. Young adults were the second largest contributors, while U5s and adults over 30 were each responsible for {$<$}\,10\% of transmission. While the specific predicted values are sensitive to the relative infectiousness of SAC, this group remained the most important contributor to mosquito infections under all realistic estimates. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} These results suggest that U5 children play a small role compared to SAC in maintaining P. falciparum transmission in southern Malawi. Models that assume biting homogeneity overestimate the importance of U5s. To reduce transmission, interventions will need to reach more SAC and young adults. This publicly available model can be used by others to estimate age-specific transmission contributions in epidemiologically similar sites with local parameter estimates of P. falciparum prevalence and bed net use.},

  abstract = {The challenge of measuring food security became increasingly thorny during the 1990s, when the number of conceptual elements proliferated in widely accepted definitions. There have been commendable recent advances in the development of simple, valid measures of â€œfood accessâ€. Yet most users apply single indicators interchangeably and capture only a portion of the full concept. Rather than tackling â€˜food insecurityâ€™ as a monolithic concept, food security assessment and action would be more effective if deconstructed into well-defined dimensions beyond the â€œavailability, access, and utilization pillarsâ€. Internationally recognized definitions and ethnographic literature support the isolation of five dimensions: (1) food sufficiency (2) nutrient adequacy (3) cultural acceptability, (4) safety, (5) certainty and stability. This paper traces the evolution of food security concepts and measures up through the first decade of the 21st century, proposes indicators to represent these five dimensions, and highlights areas where the development of new metrics is warranted.},

Children are given a single dose of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine combined with a 3-day course of amodiaquine, once a month for up to 4~months. Roll-out and scale-up of SMC has been impressive, with 12 million children receiving the intervention in 2016. There is evidence of its overall benefit in routine implementation settings, and a meta-analysis of clinical trial data showed a 75\% decrease in clinical malaria compared to placebo. SMC is not free of shortcomings. Its target zone includes many hard-to-reach areas, both because of poor infrastructure and because of political instability. Treatment adherence to a 3-day course of preventive treatment has not been fully documented, and could prove challenging. As SMC is scaled up, integration into a broader, community-based paradigm which includes other preventive and curative activities may prove beneficial, both for health systems and for recipients.},

  abstract = {Background Intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in children (IPTc) involves the administration of a full course of an anti-malarial treatment to children under 5 years old at specified time points regardless of whether or not they are known to be infected, in areas where malaria transmission is seasonal. It is important to determine the costs associated with IPTc delivery via community based volunteers and also the potential savings to health care providers and caretakers due to malaria episodes averted as a consequence of IPTc. Methods Two thousand four hundred and fifty-one children aged 3â€“59 months were randomly allocated to four groups to receive: three days of artesunate plus amodiaquine (AS+AQ) monthly, three days of AS+AQ bimonthly, one dose of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) bi-monthly or placebo. This paper focuses on incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the three IPTc drug regimens as delivered by community based volunteers (CBV) in Hohoe, Ghana compared to current practice, i.e. case management in the absence of IPTc. Financial and economic costs from the publicly funded health system perspective are presented. Treatment costs borne by patients and their caretakers are also estimated to present societal costs. The costs and effects of IPTc during the intervention period were considered with and without a one year follow up. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for uncertainty. Results Economic costs per child receiving at least the first dose of each course of IPTc show SP bimonthly, at US\$8.19, is the cheapest to deliver, followed by AS+AQ bimonthly at US\$10.67 and then by AS+AQ monthly at US\$14.79. Training, drug delivery and supervision accounted for approximately 20â€“30\% each of total unit costs. During the intervention period AS \& AQ monthly was the most cost effective IPTc drug regimen at US\$67.77 (61.71â€“74.75, CI 95\%) per malaria case averted based on intervention costs only, US\$64.93 (58.92â€“71.92, CI 95\%) per malaria case averted once the provider cost savings are included and US\$61.00 (54.98, 67.99, CI 95\%) when direct household cost savings are also taken into account. SP bimonthly was US\$105.35 (75.01â€“157.31, CI 95\%) and AS \& AQ bimonthly US\$211.80 (127.05â€“399.14, CI 95\%) per malaria case averted based on intervention costs only. The incidence of malaria in the post intervention period was higher in children who were {$<$}1 year old when they received AS+AQ monthly compared to the placebo group leading to higher cost effectiveness ratios when one year follow up is included. The cost per child enrolled fell considerably when modelled to district level as compared to those encountered under trial conditions. Conclusions We demonstrate how cost-effective IPTc is using three different drug regimens and the possibilities for reducing costs further if the intervention was to be scaled up to the district level.

This paper estimates the effect of a school reform in Punjab, Pakistan, in which 4,276 poorly performing public primary schools (around 10 percent of the total) were contracted out to private operators in a single school year. These schools remain free to students and the private operator receives a per-student subsidy equivalent to less than half of spending in government schools. Using a difference-in-difference framework we estimate that enrolment in converted schools increased by over 60 percent. Converted schools see a slight decline in overall average test scores, but this may be a composition effect rather than a treatment effect. Schools with the same number or fewer students as in the previous year saw no change in average test scores.},

This study aims to approximate the funding for the R\&D of the ChAdOx technology and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and assess the transparency of funding reporting mechanisms. Design: We conducted a scoping review and publication history analysis of the principal investigators to reconstruct the funding for the R\&D of the ChAdOx technology. We matched award numbers with publicly-accessible grant databases. We filed Freedom Of Information (FOI) requests to the University of Oxford for the disclosure of all grants for ChAdOx R\&D. Results: We identified 100 peer-reviewed articles relevant to ChAdOx technology published between 01/2002 and 10/2020, extracting 577 mentions of funding bodies from funding acknowledgement statements. Government funders from overseas were mentioned 158 (27.4\%), the U.K. government 147 (25.5\%) and charitable funders 138 (23.9\%) times. Grant award numbers were identified for 215 (37.3\%) mentions, amounts were available in the public realm for 121 (21.0\%) mentions. Based on the FOIs, until 01/2020, the European Commision (34.0\%), Wellcome Trust (20.4\%) and CEPI (17.5\%) were the biggest funders of ChAdOx R\&D. From 01/2020, the U.K. Department of Health and Social Care was the single largest funder (89.3\%). The identified R\&D funding was Â£104,226,076 reported in the FOIs, and Â£228,466,771 reconstructed from the literature search. Conclusions: Our study identified that public funding accounted for 97.1-99.0\% of the funding towards the R\&D of ChAdOx and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. We furthermore encountered a severe lack of transparency in research funding reporting mechanisms.},

Nonetheless, we find little evidence that winning a lottery provides any systematic benefit across a wide variety of traditional academic measures.

  abstract = {This paper formulates and estimates multistage production functions for childrenâ€™s cognitive and noncognitive skills. Skills are determined by parental environments and investments at different stages of childhood. We estimate the elasticity of substitution between investments in one period and stocks of skills in that period to assess the benefits of early investment in children compared to later remediation. We establish nonparametric identification of a general class of production technologies based on nonlinear factor models with endogenous inputs. A by-product of our approach is a framework for evaluating childhood and schooling interventions that does not rely on arbitrarily scaled test scores as outputs and recognizes the differential effects of the same bundle of skills in different tasks. Using the estimated technology, we determine optimal targeting of interventions to children with different parental and personal birth endowments. Substitutability decreases in later stages of the life cycle in the production of cognitive skills. It is roughly constant across stages of the life cycle in the production of noncognitive skills. This finding has important implications for the design of policies that target the disadvantaged. For most configurations of disadvantage it is optimal to invest relatively more in the early stages of childhood than in later stages.},

However, the transfer contained ten food items, and there was large variation in the extent to which individual foods were extra-marginal and distorting.

Much of this literature focuses on rich countries, but researchers are increasingly taking advantage of new sources of data and identification to study the long reach of childhood health in developing countries. Health in early life may be a more significant determinant of adult outcomes in these countries because health insults are more frequent, the capacity to remediate is more limited, and multiple shocks may interact. However, the underlying relationships may also be more difficult to measure, given significant mortality selection. We survey recent evidence on the adult correlates of early-life health and the long-term effects of shocks resulting from disease, famine, malnutrition, pollution, and war.},

  abstract = {Placebo-controlled trials are the ideal for evaluating medical treatment e cacy. They allow for control of the placebo e ect and are most e cient, requiring the smallest numbers of patients to detect a treatment e ect. A placebo control is ethically justiÃ¿ed if no standard treatment exists, if the standard treatment has not been proven e cacious, there are no risks associated with delaying treatment or escape clauses are included in the protocol. Where possible and justiÃ¿ed, they should be the Ã¿rst choice for medical treatment evaluation. Given the large number of proven e ective treatments, placebo-controlled trials are often unethical. In these situations active-controlled trials are generally appropriate. The non-inferiority trial is appropriate for evaluation of the e cacy of an experimental treatment versus an active control when it is hypothesized that the experimental treatment may not be superior to a proven e ective treatment, but is clinically and statistically not inferior in e ectiveness. These trials are not easy to design. An active control must be selected. Good historical placebo-controlled trials documenting the e cacy of the active control must exist. From these historical trials statistical analysis must be performed and clinical judgement applied in order to determine the non-inferiority margin M and to assess assay sensitivity. The latter refers to establishing that the active drug would be superior to the placebo in the setting of the present non-inferiority trial (that is, the constancy assumption). Further, a putative placebo analysis of the new treatment versus the placebo using data from the non-inferiority trial and the historical active versus placebo-controlled trials is needed. Useable placebo-controlled historical trials for the active control are often not available, and determination of assay sensitivity and an appropriate M is di cult and debatable. Serious consideration to expansions of and alternatives to non-inferiority trials are needed. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the efficacy of class-size reductions as a strategy to improve pupilsâ€™ learning outcomes in India. It uses a credible identification strategy to address the endogeneity of class-size, by relating the difference in a studentâ€™s achievement score across subjects to the difference in his/her class size across subjects. Pupil fixed effects estimation shows a relationship between class size and student achievement which is roughly flat or non-decreasing for a large range of class sizes from 27 to 51, with a negative effect on learning outcomes occurring only after class size increases beyond 51 pupils. The class-size effect varies by gender and by subject-stream. The fact that up to a class-size of roughly 40 in science subjects and roughly 50 in non-science subjects, there is no reduction in pupil learning as class size increases, implies that there is no learning gain from reducing class size below 40 in science and below 50 in non-science. This has important policy implications for pupil teacher ratios (PTRs) and thus for teacher appointments in India, based on considerations of cost-effectiveness. When generalised, our findings suggest that India experienced a value-subtraction from spending on reducing class-sizes, and that the US\$3.6 billion it spent in 2017-18 on the salaries of 0.4 million new teachers appointed between 2010 and 2017 was wasteful spending rather than an investment in improving learning. We show that India could save US\$ 19.4 billion (Rupees 1,45,000 crore in Indian currency) per annum by increasing PTR from its current 22.8 to 40, without any reduction in pupil learning.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the widespread perception in India that the country has an acute teacher shortage of about one million teachers in public elementary schools, a view repeated in Indiaâ€™s National Education Policy 2020. Using official DISE data, we show that there is hardly any net teacher deficit in the country since there is roughly the same number of surplus teachers as the number of teacher vacancies. Secondly, we show that measuring teacher requirements after removing the estimated fake students from enrolment data greatly reduces the required number of teachers and increases the number of surplus teachers, yielding an estimated net surplus of about 342,000 teachers. Thirdly, we show that if we both remove fake enrolment and also make a suggested hypothetical change to the teacher allocation rule to adjust for the phenomenon of emptying public schools (which has slashed the national median size of public schools to a mere 64 students, and rendered many schools â€˜tinyâ€™), the estimated net teacher surplus is about 764,000 teachers. Fourthly, we highlight that if government does fresh recruitment to fill the supposed nearly one-million vacancies as promised in the National Education Policy 2020, the already modest national mean pupil-teacher-ratio of 22.8 would fall to 15.9, at a permanent fiscal cost of nearly Rupees 480 billion (USD 6.6 billion) per year in 2017-18 prices, which is higher than the individual GDPs of 56 countries in that year. The paper highlights the major economic efficiencies that can result from an evidence-based approach to teacher recruitment and deployment policies.},

  abstract = {Objective: Test associations between household water and sanitation (W\&S) and childrenâ€™s concurrent and subsequent Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) scores. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Ethiopia, India, Peru, Vietnam. Participants: 7269 children. Primary outcome measures: PPVT scores at 5 and 8 years. Key exposure variables were related to W\&S, and collected at 1, 5 and 8 years, including â€˜improvedâ€™ water (eg, piped, public tap or standpipe) and â€˜improvedâ€™ toilets (eg, collection, storage, treatment and recycling of human excreta). Results: Access to improved water at 1 year was associated with higher language scores at 5 years (3/4 unadjusted associations) and 8 years (4/4 unadjusted associations). Ethiopian children with access to improved water at 1 year had test scores that were 0.26 SD (95\% CI 0.17 to 0.36) higher at 5 years than children without access. Access to improved water at 5 years was associated with higher concurrent PPVT scores (in 3/4 unadjusted associations), but not later scores (in 1/4 unadjusted associations). 5-year-old Peruvian children with access to improved water had better concurrent performance on the PPVT (0.44 SD, 95\% CI 0.30 to 0.59) than children without access to improved water. Toilet access at 1 year was also associated with better PPVT scores at 5 years (3/4 unadjusted associations) and sometimes associated with test results at 8 years (2/4 unadjusted associations). Toilet access at 5 years was associated with concurrent PPVT scores (3/4 unadjusted associations). More than half of all associations in unadjusted models (water and toilets) persisted in adjusted models, particularly for toilets in India, Peru and Vietnam. Conclusions: Access to â€˜improvedâ€™ water and toilets had independent associations with childrenâ€™s PPVT scores},

State dependence in school attendance further implies that these responses to short-run shocks have long-term consequences on childrenâ€™s human capital development. Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs, where the condition is on school attendance, have been shown to be effective in increasing educational achievements and reducing child work. We ask the question here of whether or not children who benefit from conditional transfers are protected from the impacts of shocks on school enrollment and work. We develop a model of a householdâ€™s decision regarding child school and work under conditions of a school re-entry cost, conditional transfers, and exposure to shocks. We take model predictions to the data using a panel from Mexicoâ€™s Progresa experience with randomized treatment. Results show that there is strong state dependence in school enrollment. We find that the conditional transfers helped protect enrollment, but did not refrain parents from increasing child work in response to shocks. These results reveal that CCT programs can provide an additional benefit to recipients in acting as safety nets for the schooling of the poor.},

Accurate measurement of profits from microenterprises is therefore critical for studying poverty and inequality, measuring the returns to education, and evaluating the success of microfinance programs. However, a myriad of problems plague the measurement of profits. This paper reports on a variety of different experiments conducted to better understand the importance of some of these problems, and to draw recommendations for collecting profit data. In particular, we (i) examine how far we can reconcile self-reported profits and reports of revenue minus expenses through more detailed questions; (ii) examine recall errors in sales, and report on the results of experiments which randomly allocated account books to firms; and (iii) asked firms how much firms like theirs underreport sales in surveys like ours, and had research assistants observe the firms at random times 15â€“16 times during a month to provide measures for comparison. We conclude that firms underreport revenues by about 30\%, that account diaries have significant impacts on both revenues and expenses, but not on profits, and that simply asking profits provides a more accurate measure of firm profits than detailed questions on revenues and expenses.},

We present the first experimental evidence on this question to date in the context of a unique policy change in Indonesia that led to a permanent doubling of base teacher salaries. Using a large-scale randomized experiment across a representative sample of Indonesian schools that affected more than 3,000 teachers and 80,000 students, we find that the doubling of pay significantly improved teacher satisfaction with their income, reduced the incidence of teachers holding outside jobs, and reduced self-reported financial stress. Nevertheless, after two and three years, the doubling in pay led to no improvements in measures of teacher effort or student learning outcomes, suggesting that the salary increase was a transfer to teachers with no discernible impact on student outcomes. Thus, contrary to the predictions of various efficiency wage models of employee behavior (including gift-exchange, reciprocity, and reduced shirking), as well as those of a model where effort on pro-social tasks is a normal good with a positive income elasticity, we find that unconditional increases in salaries of incumbent teachers had no meaningful positive impact on student learning.},

  abstract = {Using nationally representative data over three decades for India, we investigate mechanisms underlying parental motivation to invest differentially between their sonsâ€™ and daughtersâ€™ education. We identify three channels: strong son preference, meta son preference (resulting in â€œunwanted girlsâ€), and the resource concentration motivation. We find that gender gaps in educational quantity outcomes have declined significantly for all children. However, gender gaps in the quality of education have increased over the period, and the increase is the largest in families with unwanted girls, i.e. due to an intensification of meta son preference, followed by families motivated by resource concentration.},

  abstract = {This article brings a historical perspective to explain the recent dissemination of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as the new Bgold standard\^ method to assess international development projects. Although the buzz around RCT evaluations dates from the 2000s, we show that what we are witnessing now is a second wave of RCTs, while a first wave began in the 1960s and ended by the early 1980s. Drawing on content analysis of 123 RCTs, participant observation, and secondary sources, we compare the two waves in terms of the participants in the network of expertise required to carry out field experiments and the characteristics of the projects evaluated. The comparison demonstrates that researchers in the second wave were better positioned to navigate the political difficulties caused by randomization. We explain the differences in the expertise network and in the type of projects as the result of concurrent transformations in the fields of development aid and the economics profession. We draw on Andrew Abbottâ€™s concept of Bhinges,\^ as well as on Bourdieuâ€™s concept of Bhomology\^ between fields, to argue that the similar positions and parallel struggles conducted by two groups of actors in the two fields served as the basis for a cross-field alliance, in which RCTs could function as a Bhinge\^ linking together the two fields.},

Research in cognitive science suggests that a preschool pedagogy in which numerate adults engage childrenâ€™s spontaneous, non-symbolic mathematical concepts, could improve their school achievement. To test this suggestion, we designed and evaluated a game-based preschool curriculum aimed to exercise childrenâ€™s emerging skills in number and geometry. In a randomized field experiment with 1,540 children (4.9-years-old, on average) in 214 Indian preschools, four months of math gameplay yielded marked and enduring improvement on the exercised intuitive abilities, relative to no-treatment and active control conditions. Math-trained children also showed immediate gains on symbolic mathematical skills, but no advantage in subsequent learning of the language and concepts of school mathematics.},

Do frictions prevent parents, particularly low-income parents, from acting on this information when making decisions? I conduct a field experiment in Malawi to test this. I find that parentsâ€™ baseline beliefs about their childrenâ€™s academic performance are inaccurate. Providing parents with clear and digestible academic performance information causes them to update their beliefs and correspondingly adjust their investments: they increase the school enrollment of their higher-performing children, decrease the enrollment of their lower-performing children, and choose educational inputs that are more closely matched to their childrenâ€™s academic level. These effects demonstrate the presence of important frictions preventing the use of available information, with heterogeneity analysis suggesting the frictions are worse among the poor.},

Admitted females are 10.1 percentage points less likely to be pregnant in their teens, and males are 4.4 percentage points less likely to be incarcerated. We find little impact of the Promise Academy on self-reported health. These eâ†µects are larger than those expected from test score increases alone, implying that high achieving charter schools alter more than cognitive ability.},

  abstract = {We summarize the available evidence on the extent to which expenditures on early childhood education programs constitute worthy social investments in the human capital of children. We provide an overview of existing early childhood education programs, and then summarize results from a substantial body of methodologically sound evaluations of the impacts of early childhood education. The evidence supports few unqualified conclusions. Many early childhood education programs appear to boost cognitive ability and early school achievement in the short run. However, most of them show smaller impacts than those generated by the best-known programs, and their cognitive impacts largely disappear within a few years. Despite this fade-out, long-run follow-ups from a handful of well-known programs show lasting positive effects on such outcomes as greater educational attainment, higher earnings, and lower rates of crime. It is uncertain what skills, behaviors, or developmental processes are particularly important in producing these longer-run impacts. Our review also describes different models of human development used by social scientists, examines heterogeneous results across groups, and tries to identify the ingredients of early childhood education programs that are most likely to improve the performance of these programs.},

  abstract = {Lack of cash on hand is a significant obstacle in accessing healthcare in developing countries. This study reports the assessment of the impact of mobile money services on maternal healthcare utilization in extreme weatherâ€”droughts and floods. Extreme weather conditions may negatively affect farm income and consequently discourage household members to seek healthcare; floods may also add to the challenge of traveling to a healthcare site. We hypothesize that mobile money adoption would motivate rural Ugandan women to receive maternal care in the face of such weather shocks. By receiving remittances utilizing mobile money, poor rural households may have more cash in hand to overcome weather shocks, which might change womenâ€™s health-seeking behavior. We apply communityand mother-fixed effects models to longitudinal panel data. We find evidence that mobile money use absorbs the weather shocks and encourages the utilization of facility delivery and skilled birth attendance. The robustness of the shock-smoothing effect is shown by a similar effect found in the utilization of postnatal care. In contrast, the models fail to reject the null hypothesis of no shock-smoothing effect of mobile money on antenatal care. The results of the heterogeneity analysis imply two things; a flood is more harmful than a drought for the uptake of maternal care; mobile money is more effective in facilitating maternal care against droughts than floods.},

  abstract = {Background Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is usually based on trials where patients are randomized individually into two different, parallel, treatment groups. This paper concentrates on RCTs of a different designâ€”two-period, twotreatment cross-over trials. Methods The characteristics of these trials are outlined, with detailed examples of methods for analysis for both continuous and binary data. These case studies are then extended into the context of a meta-analysis. The Cochrane Library was surveyed to assess current practice for synthesis. Results Methods are described for continuous and binary data for use both when the necessary paired data are given and also when they need to be calculated or imputed, and some suggestions are provided to help people wishing to synthesize data from cross-over trials into meta-analyses. The survey suggested that about 8\% of the trials in the Cochrane library were cross-over trials and 18\% of the reviews referred to such trials, although there was no consistent approach to their inclusion into the reviews. Conclusions Methods do exist for including valuable information from two-period, twotreatment cross-over trials into quantitative reviews. However, poor reporting of cross-over trials will often impede attempts to perform a meta-analysis using the available methods.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between the World Bank and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) between the 1960s and the 1980s. It focuses on the Co-operative Program (CP) between the two organizations, which was established in 1964 and lasted officially until 1989. In the context of the Co-operative Program, the Education Financing Division (EFD) was established, a joint unit located in UNESCO, with the purpose of carrying out technical missions to assist governments in the identification and preparation of educational projects and the formulation of funding requests to the World Bank. Drawing on archival research and interviews with former UNESCO and World Bank officials, the paper traces the history of the Co-operative Program, which was characterized by intense power struggles exacerbated by Cold War tenÂ­ sions. During the 25 years of the duration of the Co-operative Program, the World Bank developed into the most influential policy shaper for education in developing countries, while the influence of UNESCO, created in the post-World War II order as the United Nationsâ€™ designated organization for education, declined. Using Bourdieuâ€™s concept of fields and DiMaggio and Powellâ€™s concept of isomorphism as analytical lenses, the World Bankâ€™s expansion to a development agency will be explained by its greater autonomy as a field, endowed with more capital based on the rationalization of education and isomorphic processes of professionalization of the â€œfield of powerâ€ of educational planning. To the detriment of UNESCO, the World Bank became the powerhouse of a global governance structure that was built with support from the United States government and furthered by the rise of economics.},

So far, data to study this question have been limited. Here we evaluate the effect of school closures on primary school performance using exceptionally rich data from the Netherlands (nâ‰ˆ350,000). The Netherlands represents a best-case scenario with a relatively short lockdown (8 weeks) and high degree of technological preparedness. We use the fact that national exams took place before and after lockdown, and compare progress during this period to the same period in the three previous years using a difference-in-differences design. Our results reveal a learning loss of about 3 percentile points or 0.08 standard deviations. These results remain robust when balancing on the estimated propensity of treatment and using maximum entropy weights, or with fixed-effects specifications that compare students within the same school and family. Losses are up to 55\% larger among students from less-educated homes. Investigating mechanisms, we find that most of the effect reflects the cumulative impact of knowledge learned rather than transitory influences on the day of testing. The average learning loss is equivalent to a fifth of a school year, nearly exactly the same period that schools remained closed. These results imply that students made little or no progress whilst learning from home, and suggest much larger losses in countries less prepared for remote learning.},

So far, data to study this question have been limited. Here we evaluate the effect of school closures on primary school performance using exceptionally rich data from The Netherlands (               n               â‰ˆ 350,000). We use the fact that national examinations took place before and after lockdown and compare progress during this period to the same period in the 3 previous years. The Netherlands underwent only a relatively short lockdown (8 wk) and features an equitable system of school funding and the worldâ€™s highest rate of broadband access. Still, our results reveal a learning loss of about 3 percentile points or 0.08 standard deviations. The effect is equivalent to one-fifth of a school year, the same period that schools remained closed. Losses are up to 60\% larger among students from less-educated homes, confirming worries about the uneven toll of the pandemic on children and families. Investigating mechanisms, we find that most of the effect reflects the cumulative impact of knowledge learned rather than transitory influences on the day of testing. Results remain robust when balancing on the estimated propensity of treatment and using maximum-entropy weights or with fixed-effects specifications that compare students within the same school and family. The findings imply that students made little or no progress while learning from home and suggest losses even larger in countries with weaker infrastructure or longer school closures.},

  abstract = {On March 16, 2020, the government of the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte imposed an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in Luzon (including its associated islands), which is effectively a total lockdown, restricting the movement of the population except for necessity, work, and health circumstances, in response to the growing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the country. Additional lockdown restrictions mandated the temporary closure of non-essential shops and businesses. The ECQ came in after two days of the implementation of community quarantine in Metro Manila. The ECQ was originally set to last until April 12, but President Duterte accepted the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) to extend it until April 30. On May 1, it was extended again until May 15 but only on selected places which are considered high-risk areas while low-risk to moderate-risk areas were placed under general community quarantine (GCQ or a less strict quarantine), including the rest of the country. On May 12, the government announced that only Metro Manila and Laguna in Luzon would be under modified ECQ o MECQ from May 16 to 31 because these areas are categorized as high-risk while moderate risk places are going to be under GCQ. Originally, low-risk areas would neither be under ECQ nor GCQ but it was later clarified that low-risk areas would be under modified GCQ. On May 15, a resolution by the IATF-EID declared additional areas in Luzon under MECQ from May 16 to 31 namely Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga (including Angeles), and Zambales. On May 28, President Duterte downgraded the tier of quarantine of Metro Manila and other areas in Luzon to GCQ starting on June 1. The ECQ caused the mobilization of Philippine government agencies and local government units as well as the passing of Republic Act No. 11469 or the "Bayanihan to Heal as One Act" in order to resolve the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. The economic, environmental, political, social and cultural impact of the lockdown affects around 57 million people under quarantine. The effectiveness of the ECQ is noted by a study done by the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team of the University of the Philippines. However, many ECQ violators have been documented throughout the duration of the ECQ. Thus, Philippine authorities imposed stricter measures to further combat people disobeying ECQ rules. At the same time, various groups aired their concerns on human rights violations committed by these authorities implementing the rules regarding the ECQ.},

Skills are determined by parental environments and investments at different stages of childhood. We estimate the elasticity of substitution between investments in one period and stocks of skills in that period to assess the benefits of early investment in children compared to later remediation. We establish nonparametric identification of a general class of production technologies based on nonlinear factor models with endogenous inputs. A by-product of our approach is a framework for evaluating childhood and schooling interventions that does not rely on arbitrarily scaled test scores as outputs and recognizes the differential effects of the same bundle of skills in different tasks. Using the estimated technology, we determine optimal targeting of interventions to children with different parental and personal birth endowments. Substitutability decreases in later stages of the life cycle in the production of cognitive skills. It is roughly constant across stages of the life cycle in the production of noncognitive skills. This finding has important implications for the design of policies that target the disadvantaged. For most configurations of disadvantage it is optimal to invest relatively more in the early stages of childhood than in later stages.},

In this review, we examine 142 recent empirical studies (from 2014 onward) on how to increase access to and improve the quality of education across the continent, specifically examining how these studies update previous research findings. We observe growing sophistication in the design of studies and an increase in studies with long-term outcomes. We identify several areas where new studies provide rigorous evidence on topics that do not figure prominently in earlier evidence syntheses. New evidence shows promising impacts of structured pedagogy interventions (which typically provide a variety of inputs, such as lesson plans and training for teachers together with new materials for students) and of mother tongue instruction interventions, as well as from a range of teacher programs, including both remunerative (pay-for-performance of various designs) and non-remunerative (coaching and certain types of training) programs. School feeding delivers gains in both access and learning. New studies also show long-term positive impacts of eliminating school fees for primary school and positive impacts of eliminating fees in secondary school. Education technology interventions have decidedly mixed impacts, as do school grant programs and programs providing individual learning inputs (e.g., uniforms or textbooks).},

Possible explanations for such poor outcomes include demand â€“ for example, low perceived returns to education compared to opportunity cost; and supply â€“ poor state provision and inability of parents to coordinate and finance better schooling. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial in rural Guinea Bissau to understand the effectiveness and cost of concerted supply-based interventions in such contexts. Our intervention created simple schools offering four years of education to primary-school aged children in lieu of the government. At endline, children receiving the intervention scored 58.1 percentage points better than controls on early grade reading and math tests, demonstrating that the intervention taught children to read and perform basic arithmetic, from a counterfactual condition of very high illiteracy. Our results provide evidence that particularly needy areas may require more concerted, dramatic interventions in education than those usually considered, but that such interventions hold great potential for increasing education levels among the worldâ€™s poorest people.},

We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale. A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people. By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without need for mass quarantines (â€˜lock-downsâ€™) that are harmful to society. We discuss the ethical requirements for an intervention of this kind.},

The five practices in the bundle are increased instructional time, more effective teachers and administrators, high-dosage tutoring, data-driven instruction, and a culture of high expectations. The findings show that injecting best practices from charter schools into traditional Houston public schools significantly increases student math achievement in treated elementary and secondary schoolsâ€”by 0.15 to 0.18 standard deviations a yearâ€”and has little effect on reading achievement. Similar bundles of practices are found to significantly raise math achievement in analyses for public schools in a field experiment in Denver and program in Chicago.},

Across two years, principals were provided 300 hours of training on lesson planning, data-driven instruction, and teacher observation and coaching. The findings show that offering management training to principals significantly increases student achievement in all subjects in year one and has an insignificant effect in year two. We argue that the results in year two are driven by principal turnover, coupled with the cumulative nature of the training. Schools with principals who are predicted to remain in their positions for both years of the experiment demonstrate large treatment effects in both years â€“ particularly those with principals who are also predicted to implement the training with high fidelity â€“ while those with principals that are predicted to leave have statistically insignificant effects in each year of treatment.},

This policy delayed grade progression for all children who were in the school system in 1978 and led to an increase in their absolute age-for-grade by six months. Using a regression discontinuity design, we use this policy variation to estimate the policy on long-term cognition. We find that a one-year delay leads to between 0.24â€“0.32 standard deviation (SD) increase in cognitive abilities 30 years later. We interpret this finding as the impact of absolute maturity on long-term cognitive functions. We find a stronger effect for males that is noisily estimated. We also a find a stronger effect for individuals who did not experience early life nutrition deficits as proxied by their adult heights. We discuss pathways from the policy to long-term cognitive functioning.},

This paper studies the infancy stage of the public education system in China and focuses specifically on the role of its most important local elite group â€“ lower degree holders under the civil service exam system. I construct a new county-level dataset linking local elites to public education provision. I find counties that had larger elite groups built significantly more public primary schools and spent higher expenditure on education. This finding is robust to various checks, including two IV approaches. Furthermore, the positive effect of local elites was larger in counties with the weaker formal ruling, proxied by both high frequent turnover of local magistrates and distance to provincial capital. These results suggest that the informal governance imposed by local elites was critically important for the provision of public goods, especially in societies where the formal ruling was weak.},

  abstract = {Background Reports of waning vaccine-induced immunity against COVID-19 have begun to surface. With that, the comparable long-term protection conferred by previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational study comparing three groups: (1)SARS-CoV-2-naÃ¯ve individuals who received a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, (2)previously infected individuals who have not been vaccinated, and (3)previously infected and single dose vaccinated individuals. Three multivariate logistic regression models were applied. In all models we evaluated four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic disease, COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. The follow-up period of June 1 to August 14, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel. Results SARS-CoV-2-naÃ¯ve vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95\% CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant (P{$<$}0.001) for symptomatic disease as well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time before vaccination (from March 2020 to February 2021), evidence of waning natural immunity was demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 naÃ¯ve vaccinees had a 5.96-fold (95\% CI, 4.85 to 7.33) increased risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95\% CI, 5.51 to 9.21) increased risk for symptomatic disease. SARS-CoV-2-naÃ¯ve vaccinees were also at a greater risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations compared to those that were previously infected. Conclusions This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.},

  abstract = {India is at the forefront of the use of digital technology to transform the way in which citizens interact with states. This paper provides a picture of the perceived impact of digitization reforms in Rajasthan, based on a survey of beneficiaries of several benefit programs. We find that, on balance, the reforms appear to have improved perceptions of service delivery despite some difficulties during the digitization process and the possibilityâ€”which we cannot fully assess with our dataâ€”that there could have been some degree of exclusion. The proportion of people preferring the new systems, at 40â€“60 percent, far exceeded the proportion who expressed a preference for the old system (5â€“12 percent). In the case of food and cooking gas subsidy reforms, the reason for the preference is relatively clearâ€”they considered that the new systems gave them greater control over their entitlements and reduced the ability of others to claim their benefits or divert them. The main problems arise from biometric authentication. Shifting pensions from postal delivery to bank deposits is overwhelmingly supported, partly because of better regularity. Reforms in Rajasthan also had two cross-cutting goals: financial inclusion and womenâ€™s empowerment. Our survey confirms that virtually all respondents have bank accounts, often two or more per family, as do all heads of household who are officially mandated to be women. Two thirds of these women had not owned bank accounts before the reforms. Mobiles emerge, however, as a male preserve. This suggests a further frontier for policies and programs to shift India towards a digital societyâ€”ensuring that all people have the capacity to access and to use digital technology.},

We report substantial effects on the earnings of participants in a randomized intervention conducted in 1986â€“1987 that gave psychosocial stimulation to growth-stunted Jamaican toddlers. The intervention consisted of weekly visits from community health workers over a 2-year period that taught parenting skills and encouraged mothers and children to interact in ways that develop cognitive and socioemotional skills. The authors re-interviewed 105 out of 129 study participants 20 years later and found that the intervention increased earnings by 25\%, enough for them to catch up to the earnings of a non-stunted comparison group identified at baseline (65 out of 84 participants).},

  abstract = {This paper provides new evidence on the long-run evolution of political cleavages in 21 Western democracies by exploiting a new database on the vote by socioeconomic characteristic covering over 300 elections held between 1948 and 2020. In the 1950s-1960s, the vote for democratic, labor, social democratic, socialist, and affiliated parties was associated with lower-educated and low-income voters. It has gradually become associated with higher-educated voters, giving rise to â€œmulti-elite party systemsâ€ in the 2000s-2010s: high-education elites now vote for the â€œleftâ€, while high-income elites continue to vote for the â€œrightâ€. This transition has been accelerated by the rise of green and anti-immigration movements, whose key distinctive feature is to concentrate the votes of the higher-educated and lower-educated electorate, respectively. Combining our database with historical data on political partiesâ€™ programs, we provide evidence that the reversal of the educational cleavage is strongly linked to the emergence of a new â€œsocioculturalâ€ axis of political conflict. We also discuss the evolution of other political cleavages related to age, geography, religion, gender, and the integration of new ethnoreligious minorities.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new methodology for estimating teacher value-added. Rather than imposing a normality assumption on unobserved teacher quality (as in the standard empirical Bayes approach), our nonparametric estimator permits the underlying distribution to be estimated directly and in a computationally feasible way. The resulting estimates fit the unobserved distribution very well regardless of the form it takes, as we show in Monte Carlo simulations. Implementing the nonparametric approach in practice using two separate large-scale administrative data sets, we find the estimated teacher value-added distributions depart from normality and differ from each other. To draw out the policy implications of our method, we first consider a widely-discussed policy to release teachers at the bottom of the value-added distribution, comparing predicted test score gains under our nonparametric approach with those using parametric empirical Bayes. Here the parametric method predicts similar policy gains in one data set while overestimating those in the other by a substantial margin. We also show the predicted gains from teacher retention policies can be underestimated significantly based on the parametric method. In general, the results highlight the benefit of our nonparametric empirical Bayes approach, given that the unobserved distribution of value-added is likely to be contextspecific.},

School enrollment rates have increased dramatically in developing counties since 1960, but many children still leave school at a young age and often learn little while in school. This chapter reviews recent research on the impact of education and other policies on the quantity and quality of education obtained by children in developing countries. The policies considered include not only provision of basic inputs but also policies that change the way that schools are organized. While much has been learned about how to raise enrollment rates, less is known about how to increase learning. Randomized studies offer the most promise for understanding the impact of policies on learning.},

This paper examines studies published between 1990 and 2010, in both the education literature and the economics literature, to investigate which specific school and teacher characteristics, if any, appear to have strong positive impacts on learning and time in school. Starting with over 9,000 studies, 79 are selected as being of sufficient quality. Then an even higher bar is set in terms of econometric methods used, leaving 43 â€œhigh qualityâ€ studies. Finally, results are also shown separately for 13 randomized trials. The estimated impacts on time in school and learning of most school and teacher characteristics are statistically insignificant, especially when the evidence is limited to the â€œhigh qualityâ€ studies. The few variables that do have significant effects â€“ e.g. availability of desks, teacher knowledge of the subjects they teach, and teacher absence â€“ are not particularly surprising and thus provide little guidance for future policies and programs.},

  abstract = {Background: Research on the potential impact of air pollution on the health of adults and children has grown rapidly over the last decade. Recent studies have suggested that air pollution could also be associated with adverse effects on the developing fetus. This systematic review evaluates the current level of epidemiologic evidence on the association between ambient particulate air pollution and fetal health outcomes. We also suggest further research questions. Methods: Using database searches and other approaches, we identified relevant publications published between 1966 and 2001 in English. Articles were included if they reported original data on birthweight, gestational age at delivery, or stillbirth related to directly measured nonaccidental exposure to particulate matter. Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. There was little consistency in the evidence linking particulate air pollution and fetal outcomes. Many studies had methodologic weaknesses in their design and adjustment for confounding factors. Even in well-designed studies, the reported magnitude of the effects was small and inconsistently associated with exposure at specific stages of pregnancy. Conclusions: The currently available evidence is compatible with either a small adverse effect of particulate air pollution on fetal growth and duration of pregnancy or with no effect. Further research should be directed toward clarifying and quantifying these possible effects and generating testable hypotheses on plausible biologic mechanisms.},

Next, we show how the Bartik instrument weights each of the exposure designs. Finally, we discuss how to assess the plausibility of the research design. We illustrate our results through two applications: estimating the elasticity of labor supply, and estimating the elasticity of substitution between immigrants and natives.

Most DD applications, however, exploit variation across groups of units that receive treatment at different times. This paper derives an expression for this general DD estimator, and shows that it is a weighted average of all possible two-group/ two-period DD estimators in the data. This result provides detailed guidance about how to use regression DD in practice. I define the DD estimand and show how it averages treatment effect heterogeneity and that it is biased when effects change over time. I propose a new balance test derived from a unified definition of common trends. I show how to decompose the difference between two specifications, and I apply it to models that drop untreated units, weight, disaggregate time fixed effects, control for unit-specific time trends, or exploit a third difference.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} In Niger, malaria transmission is markedly seasonal with most of the disease burden occurring in children during the rainy season. Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) with amodiaquine plus sulfadoxineâ€“pyrimethamine (AQ + SP) is recommended in the country to be administered monthly just before and during the rainy season. Moreover, clinical decisions on use of SP for intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) now depend upon the validated molecular markers for SP resistance in Plasmodium falciparum observed in the local parasite population. However, little is known about molecular markers of resistance for either SP or AQ in the south of Niger. To address this question, clinical samples which met clinical and biological criteria, were collected in Gabi, Madarounfa district, Maradi region, Niger in 2011â€“2012 (before SMC implementation). Molecular markers of resistance to pyrimethamine (pfdhfr), sulfadoxine (pfdhps) and amodiaquine (pfmdr1) were assessed by DNA sequencing. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Prior to SMC implementation, the samples showed a high proportion of clinical samples that carried the pfdhfr 51I/59R/108N haplotype associated with resistance to pyrimethamine and pfdhps 436A/F/H and 437G mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to sulfadoxine. In contrast mutations in codons 581G, and 613S in the pfdhps gene, and in pfmdr1, 86Y, 184Y, 1042D and 1246Y associated with resistance to amodiaquine, were less frequently observed. Importantly, pfdhfr I164L and pfdhps K540E mutations shown to be the most clinically relevant markers for high level clinical resistance to SP were not detected in Gabi. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Although parasites with genotypes associated with the highest levels of resistance to AQ + SP are not yet common in this setting, their importance for deployment of SMC and IPTp dictates that monitoring of these markâ€‘ers of resistance should accompany these interventions. This study also highlights the parasite heterogeneity within a small spatial area and the need to use caution when extrapolating results from surveys of molecular markers of resistâ€‘ance in a single site to inform regional policy decisions.},

Using variation in the exposure to the CSL across cohorts and variation across provinces by the intensity of additional classrooms constructed in the birth provinces as an instrumental variable, the results indicate that primary school completion reduces teenage fertility by 0.37 births and the incidence of teenage childbearing by around 28 percentage points. Exploring heterogeneous effects indicates that female education reduces teenage fertility more in provinces with lower population density and higher agricultural activity. This paper also disentangles intensive- and extensive-margin effects and explores various channels, such as postponing marriage and contraceptive use, linking education and fertility. Finally, this paper demonstrates that there are additional social benefits of education in terms of child health.},

On the one hand, domestic economic growth has created huge employment demand and job opportunities, while on the other, a shortage of skills is making more people unemployable. What adds to the irony is that there are 17 central government ministries that offer skill development initiatives through school education, institutes of higher learning and specialised vocational training institutes. The large size of the population alone cannot be Indiaâ€™s problem since China, with a similar scale of population and training structure, has better labour productivity (indicating higher skills). This paper argues that India lacks sufficient skilled workers as its existing vocational training system does not target the casual or informal workforce, which constitutes over 90 per cent of Indiaâ€™s working population. This paper examines the vocational training offered for specific skills in construction and highlights the lack of inclusiveness and poor coordination in the complex federal government structure.},

Methods and Findings: A cluster randomised trial was implemented with 5,233 children in 101 government primary schools on the south coast of Kenya in 2010â€“2012. The intervention was delivered to children randomly selected from classes 1 and 5 who were followed up for 24 months. Once a school term, children were screened by public health workers using malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and children (with or without malaria symptoms) found to be RDT-positive were treated with a six dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Given the nature of the intervention, the trial was not blinded. The primary outcomes were anaemia and sustained attention. Secondary outcomes were malaria parasitaemia and educational achievement. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. During the intervention period, an average of 88.3\% children in intervention schools were screened at each round, of whom 17.5\% were RDT-positive. 80.3\% of children in the control and 80.2\% in the intervention group were followed-up at 24 months. No impact of the malaria IST intervention was observed for prevalence of anaemia at either 12 or 24 months (adjusted risk ratio [Adj.RR]: 1.03, 95\% CI 0.93â€“1.13, p = 0.621 and Adj.RR: 1.00, 95\% CI 0.90â€“1.11, p = 0.953) respectively, or on prevalence of P. falciparum infection or scores of classroom attention. No effect of IST was observed on educational achievement in the older class, but an apparent negative effect was seen on spelling scores in the younger class at 9 and 24 months and on arithmetic scores at 24 months. Conclusion: In this setting in Kenya, IST as implemented in this study is not effective in improving the health or education of school children. Possible reasons for the absence of an impact are the marked geographical heterogeneity in transmission, the rapid rate of reinfection following AL treatment, the variable reliability of RDTs, and the relative contribution of malaria to the aetiology of anaemia in this setting.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of educational programs has accelerated dramatically in the past quarter century. With this expansion has come clear methodological improvement involving randomized control studies and other approaches for establishing causation that considerably strengthen their internal validity. Such studies are, however, conducted within individual countries with the institutional structure of the schools and the national labor markets, and they are seldom replicated either within or across countries. A natural question is whether the results of an individual high-quality educational evaluation in one country can be reasonably applied in other countries. This paper focuses on existing research into differences across countries that, while generally impossible to incorÂ­ porate into program evaluations, potentially have direct effects on key elements of policy and on the outcomes that can be expected. In particular, available cross-national studies on a variety of topics suggest using caution when generalizing evaluation results across countries, because student results are likely to vary systematically with a number of fundamental country-level institutional characteristics that are not explicitly considered in within-country evaluation analyses. Unfortunately, there is currently too little replication of basic research studies to provide explicit guidance on when and where cross-national generalizations are possible.},

To maximize incentives to acquire knowledge, exams should only reward achievement. But to identify the most able students, exams should also reward aptitude. Using a model in which schools are interested in both aptitude and achievement, we show how competition between schools leads each school to put more emphasis on aptitude tests which perform a primarily screening role, and less emphasis on achievement tests and grades which provide incentives for learning. This result is broadly consistent with the comparative reliance on aptitude tests in the United States relative to countries with more centralized education systems. We evaluate the theory through an analysis of the implicit weights on aptitude tests and grades in the admissions process of U.S. colleges. Colleges facing more competition for applicants, including public colleges with low tuition subsidies and private colleges, put more emphasis on aptitude tests.},

  abstract = {Understanding whether wide-ranging education reforms effectively improve learning outcomes is of crucial importance in many low and middle-income countries where, in spite of gains in school enrolments, learning outcomes remain poor. Ethiopia is one country experiencing the global â€˜learning crisisâ€™, and since 2008 the Government of Ethiopia has embarked on an ambitious package of reforms â€“ the General Education Quality Improvement Program (GEQIP) â€“ in order to improve the quality of basic education in the country. In this paper, we consider a suitable quantitative strategy for investigating the impact of large-scale, complex education reforms, with particular reference to the latest phase of GEQIP in Ethiopia. Quantitatively, randomised control trials (RCTs) have been considered the â€˜gold standardâ€™ to evaluate interventions; however, in the field of education, many scholars have acknowledged the limitations of RCTs particularly with respect to their external and construct validity. In light of these and other concerns, we outline our approach to assessing the impact of GEQIP-E on learning outcomes â€“ a longitudinal design which incorporates variations across time and space that we are likely to observe over the course of reform implementation.

However, due to a lack of infrastructural capacity and widespread poverty, the experience of remote learning in developing countries may have been unequal by pupilsâ€™ socioeconomic status, gender and location. This study draws evidence from a phone survey conducted by Young Lives (YL) in Ethiopia, two states of India, Peru and Vietnam enquiring which sociodemographic groups are benefiting more from remote schooling. Logit regression results suggest that students from wealthier households, urban areas and with internet access from all countries are more likely to experience remote schooling. Pupils from higher-educated households in all countries but Peru also tend to have alternative schooling. Additionally, apart from Peru, the gender difference in experiencing remote learning is not found significant. We suggest that access to remote learning resources for marginalised students would be paramount to reduce inequality in learning loss in the global South.},

  abstract = {This essay was jointly written by Peter Hurford, Kathryn Mecrow, and Simon Beard[1]. Effective altruism is about figuring out how to do the most good; when working with limited resources, whether financial or otherwise, and faced with opportunity costs, how do we measure the good of the impact of a particular program? Using examples from current projects: how good is it to give someone a bednet, hand out a pro-vegetarian leaflet, or do an hour of AI safety research? This article considers the various methods employed by EA and EA associated organizations for dealing with uncertainty in their cost effectiveness analyses. To address this, we conducted a literature review using resources on the websites of EA orgs, and reached out to the different organizations for guidance. When striving to answer these questions, we can model various parameters. For example, GiveWell mentionsthat the benefit of a deworming program depends on a number of factors that each carry their own uncertainties. Does deworming have short-term health benefits? Is it clear that deworming has long-term positive health or social impacts? How do we evaluate evidence from randomized control trials that differ from modern day deworming programs in a number of important ways? How do we proceed if some analysis suggests that deworming programs are more likely than not to have very little or no impact, but there is some possibility that deworming has a very large impact? In the process of combining these models we can employ ranges or intervals to express our uncertainty and aggregate the various inputs to create a total estimate of impact. How do we know that we have all the relevant parameters, that we have aggregated correctly, accurately assessed our uncertainty in each parameter, and made no errors? Given the emphasis of the EA movement on robustness of evidence, how do we ensure that we actually do the most good and retain the credibility of our assessments in the face of poorly researched are},

As a result, more than 1000 private schools entered the market, and the private enrollment rate increased by 20 percentage points, with greater impacts in larger, more urban, and wealthier communities. We use this differential impact to measure the effects of unrestricted choice on educational outcomes. Using panel data for about 150 municipalities, we find no evidence that choice improved average educational outcomes as measured by test scores, repetition rates, and years of schooling. However, we find evidence that the voucher program led to increased sorting, as the bbestQ public school students left for the private sector.},

In contrast, surviving plants in India and Mexico exhibit much slower growth, roughly doubling in size over the same age range. The divergence in plant dynamics suggests lower investments by Indian and Mexican plants in process efficiency, quality, and in accessing markets at home and abroad. In simple general equilibrium models, we find that the difference in life cycle dynamics could lower aggregate manufacturing productivity on the order of 25 percent in India and Mexico relative to the United States.},

With the exception of a few unpublished theoretical papers, these methods did not attract much attention in the economics literature until recently.

We find that teacher-induced learning has low persistence, with threequarters or more fading out within one year. Other measures of teacher quality produce similar or lower persistence estimates.},

Throughout the 19th century there was a growing awareness of the need for comparison groups, albeit often without the realization that randomization could be a clean method to achieve that goal. In the second and more crucial phase of this history, four separate but related disciplines introduced randomized control trials within a few years of one another in the 1920s: agricultural science; clinical medicine; educational psychology; and social policy (specifically political science). This brought increasing rigor to fields that were focusing more on causal relationships. In a third phase, the 1950s through 1970s saw a surge of interest in more applied randomized experiments in economics and elsewhere â€“ both in the lab and especially in the field.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Mass vaccination campaigns to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) are occurring in many countries; estimates of vaccine effectiveness are urgently needed to support decision making. A countrywide mass vaccination campaign with the use of an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (CoronaVac) was conducted in Chile starting on February 2, 2021. METHODS We used a prospective national cohort, including participants 16 years of age or older who were affiliated with the public national health care system, to assess the effectiveness of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with regard to preventing Covid-19 and related hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and death. We estimated hazard ratios using the extension of the Cox proportionalhazards model, accounting for time-varying vaccination status. We estimated the change in the hazard ratio associated with partial immunization (â‰¥14 days after receipt of the first dose and before receipt of the second dose) and full immunization (â‰¥14 days after receipt of the second dose). Vaccine effectiveness was estimated with adjustment for individual demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS The study was conducted from February 2 through May 1, 2021, and the cohort included approximately 10.2 million persons. Among persons who were fully immunized, the adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 65.9\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 65.2 to 66.6) for the prevention of Covid-19 and 87.5\% (95\% CI, 86.7 to 88.2) for the prevention of hospitalization, 90.3\% (95\% CI, 89.1 to 91.4) for the prevention of ICU admission, and 86.3\% (95\% CI, 84.5 to 87.9) for the prevention of Covid-19â€“related death.

  pages = {51},
  abstract = {This paper presents novel evidence on the effect of school disruptions on student long-run outcomes, exploiting variation in the prevalence of teacher strikes within and across provinces in Argentina over time. On average, a student during our analysis period lost 88 days of primary school due to teacher strikes, making this a particularly interesting case for the study of the consequences associated with school disruptions. We find robust evidence in support of adverse labor market effects when the students are between 30 and 40 years old: being exposed to the average incidence of teacher strikes during primary school reduces annual labor market earnings of males and females by 3.2 and 1.9 percent, respectively. A back-ofthe-envelope calculation suggests that this amounts to an aggregate annual earnings loss of \$2.34 billion, equivalent to the cost of raising the employment income of all Argentinian primary school teachers by 62.4 percent. We also find evidence of an increase in unemployment, an increase in the probability of not working or studying, and a decline in the skill levels of the occupations into which students sort. Our analysis suggests that these labor market effects are driven, at least in part, by a reduction in educational attainment. Using data on students who have just finished primary school, we demonstrate that many of the adverse education effects are visible immediately after primary school. We also find some suggestive evidence that exposure to teacher strikes in early grades have larger effects than strikes in later grades. Finally, our analysis identifies significant intergenerational treatment effects, such that children of individuals who were exposed to teacher strikes also experience adverse education effects.},

We then analyze the internal reliability of ASER data using variance decomposition methods. We find that while ASER data is mostly reliable for comparing state averages, it is less reliable for looking at district averages, or changes in district and state averages over time.

In most situations the sampling design is not a simple random sample and must be accounted for in the estimating model. After reviewing the current operational estimation procedure for NAEP, this paper describes a Bayesian hierarchical model for the analysis of complex large-scale assessments. The model clusters students within schools and schools within primary sampling units. The paper discusses an estimation procedure that utilizes a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. Results from two Bayesian models, one treating item parameters as known and one treating them as unknown, are compared to results from the current operational method on a simulated data set and on a subset of data from the 1998 NAEP reading assessment. The point estimates from the Bayesian model and the operational method are quite similar in most cases, but there does seem to be systematic differences in measures of uncertainty (e.g., standard errors, confidence intervals).},

Proponents of this new form of aid argue that 1) aid will be more effective when given to well-governed countries and 2) countries will respond to such rewards by pursuing sound policies. This paper is the rst systematic attempt to evaluate the second hypothesis. By exploiting discontinuities in the MCC rules and reform patterns before and after the MCC was created, we are able to estimate the MCC incentive effect. Even though the MCC is still in its infancy, we nd substantial evidence that countries respond to MCC incentives by improving their indicators. Controlling for general time trends, potential recipients of MCC funds improve 25 percent more indicators after the MCC was created than before it. While still too early to make a nal assessment, a range of speci cations yield similar results. We do not nd any corresponding increase in growth rates.},

  abstract = {Objective: Bayesian analysis can incorporate cliniciansâ€™ beliefs about treatment effectiveness into models that estimate treatment effects. Many elicitation methods are available, but it is unclear if any confer advantages based on principles of measurement science. We review belief-elicitation methods for Bayesian analysis and determine if any of them had an incremental value over the others based on its validity, reliability, and responsiveness. Study Design and Setting: A systematic review was performed. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, Current Index to Statistics, MathSciNet, and Zentralblatt Math were searched using the terms (prior OR prior probability distribution) AND (beliefs OR elicitation) AND (Bayes OR Bayesian). Studies were evaluated on: design, question stem, response options, analysis, consideration of validity, reliability, and responsiveness. Results: We identified 33 studies describing methods for elicitation in a Bayesian context. Elicitation occurred in cross-sectional studies (n 5 30, 89\%), to derive point estimates with individual-level variation (n 5 19; 58\%). Although 64\% (n 5 21) considered validity, 24\% (n 5 8) reliability, 12\% (n 5 4) responsiveness of the elicitation methods, only 12\% (n 5 4) formally tested validity, 6\% (n 5 2) tested reliability, and none tested responsiveness. Conclusions: We have summarized methods of belief elicitation for Bayesian priors. The validity, reliability, and responsiveness of elicitation methods have been infrequently evaluated. Until comparative studies are performed, strategies to reduce the effects of bias on the elicitation should be used. Ã“ 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

An implication is that the long-run rate of economic growth is the product of the degree of increasing returns and the growth rate of research effort; this is the essence of semiendogenous growth theory. This paper interprets past and future growth from a semi-endogenous perspective. For 50+ years, U.S. growth has substantially exceeded its long-run rate because of rising educational attainment, declining misallocation, and rising (global) research intensity, implying that frontier growth could slow markedly in the future. Other forces push in the opposite direction. First is the prospect of "finding new Einsteins": how many talented researchers have we missed historically because of the underdevelopment of China and India and because of barriers that discouraged women inventors? Second is the longer-term prospect that artificial intelligence could augment or even replace people as researchers. Throughout, the paper highlights many opportunities for further research.},

This important work is complicated by the multiple approaches and tools for assessing food security. In response, we have prepared a compendium and review of food security assessment tools in which we review issues of terminology, measurement, and validation. We begin by describing the evolving definition of food security and use this discussion to frame a review of the current landscape of measurement tools available for assessing food security. We critically assess the purpose/s of these tools, the domains of food security assessed by each, the conceptualizations of food security that underpin each metric, as well as the approaches that have been used to validate these metrics. Specifically, we describe measurement tools that 1) provide national-level estimates of food security, 2) inform global monitoring and early warning systems, 3) assess household food access and acquisition, and 4) measure food consumption and utilization. After describing a number of outstanding measurement challenges that might be addressed in future research, we conclude by offering suggestions to guide the selection of appropriate food security metrics.

Methods: In a randomized cross-over study, 13 patients with type 2 diabetes, 3 women and 10 men, were instructed to eat a Paleolithic diet based on lean meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, root vegetables, eggs and nuts; and a Diabetes diet designed in accordance with dietary guidelines during two consecutive 3-month periods. Outcome variables included changes in weight, waist circumference, serum lipids, C-reactive protein, blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and areas under the curve for plasma glucose and plasma insulin in the 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Dietary intake was evaluated by use of 4-day weighed food records. Results: Study participants had on average a diabetes duration of 9 years, a mean HbA1c of 6,6\% units by MonoS standard and were usually treated with metformin alone (3 subjects) or metformin in combination with a sulfonylurea (3 subjects) or a thiazolidinedione (3 subjects). Mean average dose of metformin was 1031 mg per day. Compared to the diabetes diet, the Paleolithic diet resulted in lower mean values of HbA1c (-0.4\% units, p = 0.01), triacylglycerol (-0.4 mmol/L, p = 0.003), diastolic blood pressure (-4 mmHg, p = 0.03), weight (-3 kg, p = 0.01), BMI (-1 kg/m2, p = 0.04) and waist circumference (-4 cm, p = 0.02), and higher mean values of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (+0.08 mmol/L, p = 0.03). The Paleolithic diet was mainly lower in cereals and dairy products, and higher in fruits, vegetables, meat and eggs, as compared with the Diabetes diet. Further, the Paleolithic diet was lower in total energy, energy density, carbohydrate, dietary glycemic load, saturated fatty acids and calcium, and higher in unsaturated fatty acids, dietary cholesterol and several vitamins. Dietary GI was slightly lower in the Paleolithic diet (GI = 50) than in the Diabetic diet (GI = 55).

  abstract = {We evaluated a program to improve literacy instruction on the Kenyan Coast using training workshops, semi-scripted lesson plans and weekly text message support for teachers to understand its impact on students' literacy outcomes and on the classroom practices leading to those outcomes. The evaluation ran from the beginning of Grade 1 to the end of Grade 2 in 51 government primary schools chosen at random, with 50 schools acting as controls. The intervention had an impact on classroom practices with effect sizes from 0.57 to 1.15. There was more instruction with written text and more focus on letters and sounds. There was a positive impact on 3 of 4 primary measures of children's literacy after 2 years, with effect sizes up to 0.64, and school dropout reduced from 5.3\% to 2.1\%. This approach to literacy instruction is sustainable and affordable and a similar approach has subsequently been adopted nationally in Kenya.}

Regression analysis using IRT-linked test scores and data on schooling attainment and dropout shows a strong, significant association with one standard deviation higher test scores associated with 50 percent lower odds of dropping out between the ages of 8 and 12, and a similar association between the ages of 12 and 15. Qualitative analysis indicates a direct relationship between low learning and dropout, with children and parents choosing to discontinue school when they realize how little is being learned. Qualitative findings also show that low learning interacts with and exacerbates more proximate causes of dropout, with low learning often contributing to choices of early marriage (for girls) and of leaving school to work (for both genders), with families making practical decisions about which options will best provide for children in the long run. Finally, learning, work, and poverty often interact, as the need to work to help provide for the household reduces the opportunities to learn, and low learning tilts the opportunity cost of time in favor of working. These findings suggest that low learning may play a larger role in dropout decisions, by underlying and interacting with other causes, than has been typically recognized.},

  abstract = {Learning trajectories vary amazingly widely across countries, regions, and individual students in dynamic ways. In this paper we develop a parametrized structural model of the dynamics of the learning process and use the model for suggestive policy applications. We first synthesize the existing empirical literature on learning profiles, which suggest a clear set of parameters that formally characterize the learning process. We then calibrate this model of the learning process to reproduce the distribution of observed learning outcomes in low- and middleincome countries. Applying our calibrated model to policy simulations, we find that expanding schooling to universal attainment of basic education without changing the dynamics of the learning process would produce very little additional learning. Adjusting other parameters in the model, however, has large, positive effects. Slowing the pace of curriculum, so that more children can keep up, increases average learning in grade 10 by the learning equivalent of 1.6 years of schooling. Expanding the student skill levels that learn from a given level of instruction to account for within classroom heterogeneity of learning levels increases average grade 10 learning by the equivalent of a full year of schooling. The parameters we use are flexible, to accommodate the learning process in different contexts, and future work could explore additional parameterizations and calibrations for informing plans to improve education systemsâ€™ coherence for learning.},

Growth in the use of assessment at the system level in the context of factors associated with globalisation (e.g. a utilitarian view of education, the need to develop human capital, concern for performance/results and the use of standard procedures and advanced technology) is considered.},

Official data show a steep growth of private schooling and a corresponding rapid shrinkage in the size of the government school sector in India, suggesting parental abandonment of government schools. Data show that a very large majority of private schools in most states are â€˜low-feeâ€™ when judged in relation to: state per capita income, per-pupil expenditure in the government schools, and the officiallystipulated rural minimum wage rate for daily-wage-labour. This suggests that affordability is an important factor behind the migration towards and growth of private schools. The main reason for the very low fee levels in private schools is their lower teacher salaries, which the data show to be a small fraction of the salaries paid in government schools; this is possible because private schools pay the market-clearing wage, which is depressed by a large supply of unemployed graduates in the country, whereas government schools pay bureaucratically determined minimum-wages. Private schoolsâ€™ substantially lower per-student-cost combined with their studentsâ€™ modestly higher learning achievement levels, means that they are significantly more cost-effective than government schools. The paper shows how education policies relating to private schools are harmful when formulated without seeking the evidence.},

It asks how student achievement varies with teachersâ€™ union membership and political connections. Finding that students taught by unionised or politically connected teachers have significantly lower scores, it asks to what extent this negative relationship works via such teachers applying lower effort.},

  abstract = {The targeted public distribution system (TPDS) of Indiaâ€”worldâ€™s largest food safety-net programâ€”has a reputation for poor targeting, rampant corruption and low impact. Five states of India modified TPDS by reducing targeting, lowering grain prices to Rs.1â€“3 per kg and tightening its administration. This paper assesses the impact of changes in the TPDS on household food consumption using data from a repeated cross-section of Indian households from five rounds of representative consumption surveys between 1993â€“1994 and 2009â€“2010. We use the Difference-in-Difference (DID) method to identify the policy impact, first on consumption of food-grains, and second, on food expenditure. We find that modifications in TPDS led not only to an increase in the purchase of subsidized grains from fair-price shops, but also to diversification of the food basket of poor households. We also find evidence for reduction in the diversion of grains from TPDS to the open market in reform states. Finally, we present suggestive evidence that a food policy reform is likely to fail if price and targeting policy components are not accompanied by effective administrative measures to reduce corruption and improve the logistics of subsidized food distribution. These are important findings for Indiaâ€™s own National Food Security Act (NFSA) and for other food safety-net programs throughout the developing world.},

Using keywords: television, children, infants, attention, language, education and cognition, five online databases were searched. Seventy-six studies that met all the inclusion criteria were reviewed. The findings suggest the relationship between television viewing and childrenâ€™s development is complex. First, the likely effects of television may depend on childrenâ€™s individual characteristics, family and social context. Second, the features of television, such as content and editing pace, and the type of exposure (foreground or background) may affect outcomes. Specifically, watching high-quality educational content during preschool years improves childrenâ€™s basic academic skills and predicts subsequent positive academic performance. Conversely, television viewing in infancy is disruptive to play; it reduces the quality and quantity of child-parent interactions and is associated with inattentive/hyperactive behaviours, lower executive functions, and language delay, at least in the short-term. It remains unclear whether these interactions between television and cognition are long lasting. Future research should focus on the systematic investigation of the pathways that link particular components of television and the type of exposure with individual and contextual factors, to investigate their potential unique and combined effects on development. Researchers must also address the challenge of investigating the diverse and rapidly changing technologies to which the current generation of children are exposed.},

However, effects that are small by Cohenâ€™s standards are large relative to the impacts of most field-based interventions. These benchmarks also fail to consider important differences in study features, program costs, and scalability. In this article, I present five broad guidelines for interpreting effect sizes that are applicable across the social sciences. I then propose a more structured schema with new empirical benchmarks for interpreting a specific class of studies: causal research on education interventions with standardized achievement outcomes. Together, these tools provide a practical approach for incorporating study features, costs, and scalability into the process of interpreting the policy importance of effect sizes.},

The target population is about 1â€“3 percent of the overall population for the participating countries. Several options to achieve adequate representation were presented to countries. To simplify operations, reduce costs, reduce bias, and achieve sample size goals, a probability-based link-tracing approach was designed and attempted in countries as one of the several approaches administered. In this article, we provide an evaluation of the approach and describe its application toward providing proficiency estimates with adequate representation of the target population.},

  abstract = {This paper tries to reconcile evidence from the mi.croeconometric and empirical macro growth literatures on the effect of schooling on income and GDP growth. Much microeconometric evidence suggest that education is an important causal determinant of income for individuals within countries. At a national level., however, recent studies have found that increases in educational attainment are unrelated to economic growth. This finding appears to be a spurious result of the extremely high rate of measurement error in firstdifferenced cross-country education data. After accounting for measurement error, the effect of changes in educational attainment on income growth in cross-country data is at least as great as microeconometric estimates of the rate of return to years of schooling. Another finding of the macro growth literature - that economic growth depends positively on the initial stock of human capital -is shown to result from imposing linearity and constant-coefficient assumptions on the estimates. These restrictions are often rejected by the data, and once either assumption is relaxed the initial level of education has little effect on economic growth for the average country.},

In this study, we produced a series of projections of COVID-19-related learning loss based on (a) estimates from absenteeism literature and (b) analyses of summer learning patterns of 5 million students. Under our projections, returning students are expected to start fall 2020 with approximately 63 to 68\% of the learning gains in reading and 37 to 50\% of the learning gains in mathematics relative to a typical school year. However, we project that losing ground during the school closures was not universal, with the top third of students potentially making gains in reading.},

The â€œmodelâ€ schools program established schools that admit students through an entrance exam. I estimate the effect of model schools on educational outcomes using a fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design based upon the entrance exam cutoffs. With a data set of over 63,000 students, I consider three dimensions: (i) academic achievement; (ii) educational attainment; and (iii) career choice. For academic achievement outcomes, attending a model school increases test scores in math by 0.38 standard deviations, in science by 0.26 sd, and in social science by 0.26 sd on average. Attending a model school also increases the probability of obtaining an A in tenth-grade by 20 percentage points. For educational attainment indicators, model schools increase the probability of joining pre-university by 11.5 percentage points. However, attending a model school has no effect on the choice of major in pre-university college. Furthermore, I estimate multiple local average treatment effects and find that model schools have a similar positive effect for students across the ability distribution. Lastly, the per-pupil expenditure in model schools is comparable to that of traditional public schools. Overall, this paper provides suggestive evidence that the quality of public schools can be raised but other barriers persist.},

I then discuss the role of sorting more able workers into urban areas and review an array of recent evidence on outcomes from rural-urban migration. Overall, migrants do experience substantial gains on average, though smaller than suggested by the cross-sectional gaps. I conclude that future work should help further explore the frictionsâ€”in particular, information, financial, and in land marketsâ€”that hold back rural-urban migration and may help explain the persistence of urban-rural gaps.},

  abstract = {Background: The aim of the STRIPES trial was to assess the effectiveness of providing supplementary, remedial teaching and learning materials (and an additional â€˜kitâ€™ of materials for girls) on a composite of language and mathematics test scores for children in classes two, three and four in public primary schools in villages in the Nagarkurnool division of Andhra Pradesh, India. Methods: STRIPES was a cluster randomised trial in which 214 villages were allocated either to the supplementary teaching intervention (n = 107) or to serve as controls (n = 107). 54 of the intervention villages were further randomly allocated to receive additional kit for girls. The study was not blinded. Analysis was conducted on the intention to treat principle, allowing for clustering. Results: Composite test scores were significantly higher in the intervention group (107 villages; 2364 children) than in the control group (106 villages; 2014 children) at the end of the trial (mean difference on a percentage scale 15.8; 95\% CI 13.1 to 18.6; p,0.001; 0.75 Standard Deviation (SD) difference). Composite test scores were not significantly different in the 54 villages (614 girls) with the additional kits for girls compared to the 53 villages (636 girls) without these kits at the end of the trial (mean difference on a percentage scale 0.5; 95\% CI -4.34 to 5.4; p = 0.84). The cost per 0.1 SD increase in composite test score for intervention without kits is Rs. 382.97 (Â£4.45, \$7.13), and Rs.480.59 (Â£5.58, \$8.94) for the intervention with kits. Conclusions: A 18 month programme of supplementary remedial teaching and learning materials had a substantial impact on language and mathematics scores of primary school students in rural Andhra Pradesh, yet providing a â€˜kitâ€™ of materials to girls in these villages did not lead to any measured additional benefit.},

  abstract = {This paper makes several contributions. First, it presents a â€œGuidance Noteâ€ on the framework for Social Registries, anchoring the definition of these systems in their functions along the Delivery Chain and their social policy role as inclusion systems, while clarifying terminology in a manner that is consistent with IT standards in the discussion of their architecture as information systems. Second, it illustrates the diverse typologies and trajectories of country experiences with Social Registries with respect to their (a) institutional arrangements (central and local); (b) use as inclusion systems (coverage, single or multi-program use, static or dynamic intake and registration); and (c) structure as information systems (structure of data management; degree and us of interoperability with other systems). These patterns primarily derive from a review of Social Registries in a sample of 20 countries), (Azerbaijan, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Djibouti, Georgia, Indonesia, Macedonia, Mali, Mauritius, Mexico, Montenegro, Pakistan, the Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Turkey, and Yemen). The paper also draws on experience in other countries (Kenya, Rwanda, Nigeria, Egypt, Jordan, Vietnam, India, Estonia, Belgium, the US, Canada, Australia, and others) to illustrate specific points. Third, this paper develops a basic â€œAssessment Toolâ€ covering the core building blocks of Social Registries using a â€œchecklistâ€ style of questions. Given the wide diversity of Social Registries in both their role in social policy and in their architecture, the approach is not prescriptive: it does not advocate for any specific model or blueprint for Social Registries. Any diagnostics or recommendations that emerge from use of this Guidance Note and Assessment Tool will be country specific. Some key take-away messages include: (a) the importance of recognizing both the role of the â€œfront linesâ€ for outreach, intake and registration (Social Registries as inclusion systems) and the â€œback officeâ€ functions of Social Registries as information systems; (b) the potential power of Social Registries as integrated and dynamic gateways for inclusion; (c) the recognition that Social Registries are generally part of end-to-end systems for specific programs, integrated social protection information systems, and/or even â€œwhole-of-governmentâ€ approaches; and (d) there is significant diversity in the typology and trajectories of Social Registries across countries and over time.},

  abstract = {This monograph examines progress in, and policies for, access to elementary education over the past 60 years, the role played by political factors in the process of policy formulation and implementation and the drivers and inhibitors of the implementation of reforms in elementary education in recent years in India. Drawing on interviews and documentary sources, the monograph analyses the growth in central direction and international support for elementary education alongside the parallel and at times countervailing trend towards decentralisation and community participation. It outlines the tensions between agendas focused on expansion, quality improvement, human rights and economic development that led to the legal enactment in 2009 of the Right to Education. Overall, political will is found to be an important driver of progress while corruption, resistance by vested interests and the general condition of poverty in rural areas are among the key inhibitors.

  abstract = {EdTech which includes online education, computer assisted learning (CAL), and remote instruction was expanding rapidly even before the current full-scale substitution for in-person learning at all levels of education around the world because of the coronavirus pandemic. Studies of CAL interventions have consistently found large positive effects, bolstering arguments for the widespread use of EdTech. However CAL programs, often held after school, provide not only computer-based instruction, but often additional non-technology based inputs such as more time on learning and instructional support by facilitators. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model to carefully explore the possible channels by which CAL programs might affect academic outcomes among schoolchildren. We isolate and test the technology-based effects of CAL and additional parameters from the theoretical model, by designing a novel multi-treatment field experiment with more than four thousand schoolchildren in rural China. Although we find evidence of positive overall CAL program effects on academic outcomes, when we isolate the technology-based effect of CAL (over and above traditional pencil-and-paper learning) we generally find small to null effects. Our empirical results suggest that, at times, the â€œTechâ€ in EdTech may have relatively small effects on academic outcomes, which has important implications for the continued, rapid expansion of technologies such as CAL throughout the world.},

This paper argues that reform implementation is a conflict-ridden process driven by the institutional activism of street-level bureaucrats. Through an ethnographic case study of Mahila Samkhya, a novel government program for womenâ€™s empowerment in Uttar Pradesh, India, I find that local fieldworkers committed to reform promoted girlsâ€™ education by mobilizing marginalized citizens and mediating local conflicts. Organizational processes of gender-based training and deliberation enabled fieldworkers to challenge village patriarchy and exclusion and forge programmatic ties with lower caste women. By altering rules to address the practical needs of households, fieldworkers effectively integrated disadvantaged girls into the education system. Institutional activism also engendered conflicts over rules within the bureaucracy, prompting senior officials to advocate for marginalized groups. The findings suggest the importance of institutional commitment to activism within agencies on the front lines of reform.},

Objective: We evaluated whether a Paleolithic nutritional pattern improves risk factors for chronic disease more than do other dietary interventions. Design: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the Paleolithic nutritional pattern with any other dietary pattern in participants with one or more of the 5 components of metabolic syndrome. Two reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed risk of bias. Outcome data were extracted from the first measurement time point (\#6 mo). A random-effects model was used to estimate the average intervention effect. The quality of the evidence was rated with the use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Results: Four RCTs that involved 159 participants were included. The 4 control diets were based on distinct national nutrition guidelines but were broadly similar. Paleolithic nutrition resulted in greater short-term improvements than did the control diets (random-effects model) for waist circumference (mean difference: 22.38 cm; 95\% CI: 24.73, 20.04 cm), triglycerides (20.40 mmol/L; 95\% CI: 20.76, 20.04 mmol/L), systolic blood pressure (23.64 mm Hg; 95\% CI: 27.36, 0.08 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (22.48 mm Hg; 95\% CI: 24.98, 0.02 mm Hg), HDL cholesterol (0.12 mmol/L; 95\% CI: 20.03, 0.28 mmol/L), and fasting blood sugar (20.16 mmol/L; 95\% CI: 20.44, 0.11 mmol/L).

We reviewed 30,000 articles relating cash transfer programs and height for age, finding 21 papers on 17 programs. Applying meta-analysis we examine the overarching relationship, finding that the programsâ€™ average impact on height-for-age is positive, but small and not statistically significant. We evaluate many programs, child and local characteristicsâ€™ correlation with estimated outcome. Conditional programs statistically accomplish the same as unconditional. However, conditionalities not related to health or education strongly inhibit child growth. We see girls benefiting more than boys and more disadvantaged areas benefiting more.},

Defining a personâ€™s treatment response to be a function of the entire vector of treatments received by the population, I study identification when nonparametric shape restrictions and distributional assumptions are placed on response functions. An early key result is that the traditional assumption of individualistic treatment response is a polar case within the broad class of constant treatment response (CTR) assumptions, the other pole being unrestricted interactions. Important non-polar cases are interactions within reference groups and anonymous interactions. I first study identification under Assumption CTR alone. I then strengthen this Assumption to semi-monotone response. I next discuss derivation of these assumptions from models of endogenous interactions. Finally, I combine Assumption CTR with statistical independence of potential outcomes from realized effective treatments. The findings both extend and delimit the classical analysis of randomized experiments.},

With wind speeds of up to 306km/h, TC Winston was one of the most powerful cyclones ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, and the first Category 5 cyclone to directly strike Fiji. The Government swiftly mobilised funds through its existing social protection programs to channel cash assistance to poor households and vulnerable groups. Households covered under the Poverty Benefits Scheme, Social Pension Scheme, and Care and Protection Allowance were provided with a top-up payment equivalent to three months of their regular benefits, which was designed to help them meet their basic needs. This impact evaluation: (i) assesses the impact of these top-up cash transfers on poor households; and (ii) puts forward a list of recommendations on what measures could be put in place ex-ante to improve this type of response in the case of future natural disasters.},

The results indicated significant positive effects of exposure to the program, aggregated across learning outcomes, and within each of the three outcome categories: cognitive outcomes, including literacy and numeracy; learning about the world, including health and safety knowledge; social reasoning and attitudes toward out-groups. The effects were significant across different methods, and they were observed in both low- and middleincome countries and also in high-income countries. The results are contextualized by considering the effects and reach of the program, relative to other early childhood interventions.},

School-aged children represent 26~\% of the African population, and an increasing percentage of them are scholarized. Malaria is causing 50~\% of deaths in this age group and malaria control efforts may shift the malaria burden to older age groups. Schools have been suggested as a platform for health interventions delivery (deworming, iron-folic acid, nutrients supplementation, (boost-)immunization) and as a possible delivery system for IPT in schoolchildren (IPTsc). However, the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of IPTsc is limited and the optimal therapeutic regimen remains controversial. Methods A systematic search for studies reporting efficacy and safety of IPT in schoolchildren was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials and WHO/ICTRP database, and abstracts from congresses with the following key words: intermittent, preventive treatment AND malaria OR Plasmodium falciparum AND schoolchildren NOT infant NOT pregnancy. Results Five studies were identified. Most IPTsc regimes demonstrated substantial protection against malaria parasitaemia, with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) given monthly having the highest protective effect (PE) (94~\%; 95~\% CI 93â€“96). Contrarily, SP did not provide any PE against parasitaemia. However, no IPT regimen provided a PE above 50~\% in regard to anaemia, and highest protection was provided by SP+ amodiaquine (AQ) given four-monthly (50~\%; 95~\% CI 41â€“53). The best protection against clinical malaria was observed in children monthly treated with DP (97~\%; 95~\% CI 87â€“98). However, there was no protection when the drug was given three-monthly. No severe adverse events were associated with the drugs used for IPTsc. Conclusion IPTsc may reduce the malaria-related burden in schoolchildren.

  abstract = {As a response to the low learning outcomes in even the most basic literacy and numeracy skills across the country, the Tanzanian government implemented in 2015 the â€œ3Râ€ curricular reform - reading, writing, and arithmetic - for grades one and two. This curricular shift officially allocated 80\% of the instructional time in these grades to foundational literacy and numeracy skills, and greatly diminished the focus on tangential subjects that overcrowded the previous curriculum. We evaluate the effect of this policy on learning outcomes, by using panel data from 2013-2016, and a difference-in-differences approach which leverages the variation in the timing of implementation and the cohorts impacted by the policy. We find that the policy had large, significantly positive effects for the average child: a gain of 0.18 standard deviations in Kiswahili and 0.55 standard deviations in math. These effects were augmented when teachers were trained to implement the curriculum in a timely fashion. We hypothesize that the large results stem from a combination of very low initial scores, and a successful simplification of the curriculum which allowed instruction to be focused on the development of foundational skills. The paper contributes to the overall literature on curriculum reform in developing countries, providing a case study on the large-scale implementation and effects on student learning induced by this type of policy.},

We find year-to-year correlations in value-added measures in the range of 0.2â€“0.5 for elementary school and 0.3â€“0.7 for middle school teachers. Much of the variation in measured teacher performance (roughly 30â€“60 percent) is due to sampling error from â€œnoiseâ€ in student test scores. Persistent teacher effects account for about 50 percent of the variation not due to noise for elementary teachers and about 70 percent for middle school teachers. The remaining variance is due to teacher-level time-varying factors, but little of it is explained by observed teacher characteristics. Averaging estimates from two years greatly improves their ability to predict future performance.},

We now report the long-term effects of a PD on anthropometric measurements and metabolic balance in obese postmenopausal women, in comparison with a diet according to the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR). SUBJECTS/METHODS: Seventy obese postmenopausal women (mean age 60 years, body mass index 33 kg/m2) were assigned to an ad libitum PD or NNR diet in a 2-year randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome was change in fat mass as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Both groups significantly decreased total fat mass at 6 months ( Ã€ 6.5 and Ã€ 2.6 kg) and 24 months ( Ã€ 4.6 and Ã€ 2.9 kg), with a more pronounced fat loss in the PD group at 6 months (Po0.001) but not at 24 months (P Â¼ 0.095). Waist circumference and sagittal diameter also decreased in both the groups, with a more pronounced decrease in the PD group at 6 months ( Ã€ 11.1 vs Ã€ 5.8 cm, P Â¼ 0.001 and Ã€ 3.7 vs Ã€ 2.0 cm, Po0.001, respectively). Triglyceride levels decreased significantly more at 6 and 24 months in the PD group than in the NNR group (Po0.001 and P Â¼ 0.004). Nitrogen excretion did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: A PD has greater beneficial effects vs an NNR diet regarding fat mass, abdominal obesity and triglyceride levels in obese postmenopausal women; effects not sustained for anthropometric measurements at 24 months. Adherence to protein intake was poor in the PD group. The long-term consequences of these changes remain to be studied.},

  abstract = {As shown by international experience, efforts to reform energy subsidies have a mixed record of success. This paper provides a detailed picture of the Indiaâ€™s reform of household subsidies for the purchase of LPG cooking gasâ€”the largest cash transfer program in the world. From all available evidence the reform has been a success, both in reducing leakage and diversion of LPG to the commercial market and in improving the quality of service for legitimate beneficiaries. The paper documents the process of implementation, especially de-duplication of beneficiary lists, elimination of price subsidies by direct transfers to bank accounts, and the use of Aadhaar, Indiaâ€™s biometric ID program, to improve access to poor and rural beneficiaries, especially women. Lessons for other countries include: (i) clearly articulating reform objectives helps to build strong political support; (ii) capping consumption of subsidized cylinders together with removal of market price distortion reduces black marketing and improves quality of service delivery; (iii) information campaigns and social media can encourage self-targeting and â€œnudgeâ€ the wealthy to opt out of the subsidy; and (iv) using information technology and digital ID, or Aadhaar, eliminates duplicates and provides fiscal space to target subsidies and expand access to clean cooking fuel for poor rural households, especially women.},

  abstract = {Attempts to make free and compulsory education accessible to Indian children began a little more than a century ago. A strong consciousness for the need of free and compulsory Primary Education in India was highly moved by enactment of the Compulsory Education Act in 1870 in England. Education has been formally recognized as a human right since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948. This has since then been reaffirmed in numerous global human rights treaties. Ultimately, universalization of elementary education has been one of the most important goals of educational development in India since independence. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE Act), 2009, came into force from April 1, 2010, pursuant to the Eighty-Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of India (2002), which guarantees elementary education as a fundamental right. This article attempts to delve into the checkered history of development of the free and compulsory primary education in India under the British Raj. The history of compulsory and free primary education during the British Rule in India is an uphill journey replete with suggestions, advocacies, demands, experimentations, attempts, promises, and movements within legislative framework. The British rulers adopted a good number of policies on education, but these were framed in tune with the needs of the colonial power. Consequently, compulsory and free primary education remained an unfulfilled dream during the British Raj, in spite of the stirring efforts of the Indians.},

That each method corresponds to a different target population is underappreciated in practice. Specifically, prediction at the means is often incorrectly interpreted as estimating average probabilities for the overall study population, and furthermore yields nonsensical estimates in the presence of dichotomous confounders. Default commands in popular statistical software packages often lead to inadvertent misapplication of prediction at the means., Methods: Using an applied example, we demonstrate discrepancies in predicted probabilities across these methods, discuss implications for interpretation and provide syntax for SAS and Stata., Results: Marginal standardization allows inference to the total population from which data are drawn. Prediction at the modes or means allows inference only to the relevant stratum of observations. With dichotomous confounders, prediction at the means corresponds to a stratum that does not include any real-life observations., Conclusions: Marginal standardization is the appropriate method when making inference to the overall population. Other methods should be used with caution, and prediction at the means should not be used with binary confounders. Stata, but not SAS, incorporates simple methods for marginal standardization.},

  abstract = {Antipoverty programs in developing countries are often difficult to implement; in particular, many governments lack the capacity to deliver payments securely to targeted beneficiaries. We evaluate the impact of biometrically authenticated payments infrastructure ("Smartcards") on beneficiaries of employment (NREGS) and pension (SSP) programs in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, using a large-scale experiment that randomized the rollout of Smartcards over 157 subdistricts and 19 million people. We find that, while incompletely implemented, the new system delivered a faster, more predictable, and less corrupt NREGS payments process without adversely affecting program access. For each of these outcomes, treatment group distributions first-order stochastically dominated those of the control group. The investment was cost-effective, as time savings to NREGS beneficiaries alone were equal to the cost of the intervention, and there was also a significant reduction in the "leakage" of funds between the government and beneficiaries in both NREGS and SSP programs. Beneficiaries overwhelmingly preferred the new system for both programs. Overall, our results suggest that investing in secure payments infrastructure can significantly enhance 'state capacity' to implement welfare programs in developing countries.},

This has been a controversial policy, but there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of contract teachers in improving student learning. We present experimental evidence on the impact of contract teachers using data from an 'as is' expansion of contract-teacher hiring across a representative sample of 100 randomly-selected government-run rural primary schools in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. At the end of two years, students in schools with an extra contract teacher performed significantly better than those in comparison schools by 0.16 and 0.15, in math and language tests respectively. Contract teachers were also much less likely to be absent from school than civil-service teachers (18\% vs. 27\%). Combining the experimental reduction in school-level pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) induced by the provision of an extra contract teacher, with high-quality panel data estimates of the impact of reducing PTR with a regular civil-service teacher, we show that contract teachers are not only effective at improving student learning outcomes, but that they are no less effective at doing so than regular civil-service teachers who are more qualified, better trained, and paid five times higher salaries.},

The core design challenge is managing the tradeoff between Type-II errors of inclusion (including corruption) against Type-I errors of exclusion whereby legitimate beneficiaries are denied benefits. We use a large-scale experiment randomized across 15 million beneficiaries to evaluate the effects of more stringent ID requirements based on biometric authentication on the delivery of India's largest social protection program (subsidized food) in the state of Jharkhand. By itself, requiring biometric authentication to transact did not reduce leakage, slightly increased transaction costs for the average beneficiary, and reduced benefits received by the subset of beneficiaries who had not previously registered an ID by 10\%. Subsequent reforms that made use of authenticated transaction data to determine allocations to the program coincided with large reductions in leakage, but also significant reductions in benefits received. Our results highlight that attempts to reduce corruption in welfare programs can also generate non-trivial costs in terms of exclusion and inconvenience to genuine beneficiaries.},

The intervention consisted of several global best practices in school management and included three main components: comprehensive school assessments by external school inspectors leading to customized school improvement plans, regular follow ups on progress with ongoing monitoring and support and leveraging ICT tools to make both assessments and progress visible throughout the education system. We report four main findings. First, the assessments were able to meaningfully evaluate school quality with scores being predictive of future student value-added and teacher absence. Second, though initial assessments (overseen by external consultants) were implemented well, subsequent monitoring by government officials was not affected by the intervention. Third, we find no impact on teacher absence, teacher effort in classrooms or the engagement of School Management Committees. Finally, consistent with this, the intervention had no impact on student learning outcomes. An evaluation of a larger scale up across 25,000 schools similarly finds no effects on student achievement. Our results provide direct evidence of the challenge of improving service delivery at scale in developing countries and show how well-designed plans and programs fail due to poor implementation and state capacity.},

Students who completed their full five years of primary school under the program performed significantly better than those in control schools by 0.54 and 0.35 standard deviations in math and language tests respectively. These students also scored 0.52 and 0.3 standard deviations higher in science and social studies tests even though there were no incentives on these subjects. The group teacher incentive program also had positive (and mostly significant) effects on student test scores, but the effect sizes were always smaller than that of the individual incentive program, and were not significant at the end of primary school for the cohort exposed to the program for five years.

  abstract = {Background: Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) is a promising malaria control strategy; however, the optimal regimen remains unclear. We conducted a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a single course of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), amodiaquine + SP (AQ+SP) or dihydroartemisininpiperaquine (DP) among schoolchildren to inform IPT. Methods: Asymptomatic girls aged 8 to 12 years and boys aged 8 to 14 years enrolled in two primary schools in Tororo, Uganda were randomized to receive one of the study regimens or placebo, regardless of presence of parasitemia at enrollment, and followed for 42 days. The primary outcome was risk of parasitemia at 42 days. Survival analysis was used to assess differences between regimens. Results: Of 780 enrolled participants, 769 (98.6\%) completed follow-up and were assigned a treatment outcome. The risk of parasitemia at 42 days varied significantly between DP (11.7\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 7.9, 17.1]), AQ+SP (44.3\% [37.6, 51.5]), and SP (79.7\% [95\% CI: 73.6, 85.2], p,0.001). The risk of parasitemia in SP-treated children was no different than in those receiving placebo (84.6\% [95\% CI: 79.1, 89.3], p = 0.22). No serious adverse events occurred, but AQ+SP was associated with increased risk of vomiting compared to placebo (13.0\% [95\% CI: 9.1, 18.5] vs. 4.7\% [95\% CI: 2.5, 8.8], respectively, p = 0.003). Conclusions: DP was the most efficacious and well-tolerated regimen tested, although AQ+SP appears to be a suitable alternative for IPT in schoolchildren. Use of SP for IPT may not be appropriate in areas with high-level SP resistance in Africa.},

  abstract = {Background. Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) in schoolchildren offers a promising option for malaria control. However, the optimal drug and dosing regimens for IPT remain to be determined. Methods. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 740 schoolchildren aged 6â€“14 years living in a setting of high malaria transmission in Uganda. Enrolled children were randomized to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) given once a month (IPTm), DP given once a school term (4 treatments over 12 months, IPTst), or placebo and followed for 12 months. The primary outcome was the incidence of malaria over 12 months. Secondary outcomes included parasite prevalence and anemia over 12 months. Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Results. In the placebo arm, the incidence of malaria was 0.34 episodes per person-year and the prevalence of parasitemia and anemia was 38\% and 20\%, respectively. IPTm reduced the incidence of malaria by 96\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 88\%â€“99\%, P {$<$} .0001), the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia by 94\% (95\% CI, 92\%â€“96\%, P {$<$} .0001), and the prevalence of anemia by 40\% (95\% CI, 19\%â€“56\%, P {$<$} .0001). IPTst had no significant effect on the incidence of symptomatic malaria or the prevalence of anemia, but reduced the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia by 54\% (95\% CI, 47\%â€“60\%, P {$<$} .0001). Conclusions. Monthly IPT with DP offered remarkable protection against clinical malaria, parasitemia, and anemia in schoolchildren living in a high-malaria-transmission setting.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) offers prolonged protection against malaria, but its impact on               Plasmodium falciparum               drug sensitivity is uncertain. In a trial of intermittent preventive treatment in schoolchildren in Tororo, Uganda, in 2011 to 2012, monthly DP for 1 year decreased the incidence of malaria by 96\% compared to placebo; DP once per school term offered protection primarily during the first month after therapy. To assess the impact of DP on selection of drug resistance, we compared the prevalence of key polymorphisms in isolates that emerged at different intervals after treatment with DP. Blood obtained monthly and at each episode of fever was assessed for               P. falciparum               parasitemia by microscopy. Samples from 160 symptomatic and 650 asymptomatic episodes of parasitemia were assessed at 4 loci (N86Y, Y184F, and D1246Y in               pfmdr1               and K76T in               pfcrt               ) that modulate sensitivity to aminoquinoline antimalarials, utilizing a ligase detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere assay. For               pfmdr1               N86Y and               pfcrt               K76T, but not the other studied polymorphisms, the prevalences of mutant genotypes were significantly greater in children who had received DP within the past 30 days than in those not treated within 60 days (86Y, 18.0\% versus 8.3\% [               P               = 0.03]; 76T, 96.0\% versus 86.1\% [               P               = 0.05]), suggesting selective pressure of DP. Full sequencing of               pfcrt               in a subset of samples did not identify additional polymorphisms selected by DP. In summary, parasites that emerged soon after treatment with DP were more likely than parasites not under drug pressure to harbor               pfmdr1               and               pfcrt               polymorphisms associated with decreased sensitivity to aminoquinoline antimalarials.

  abstract = {In areas where there is an insufficient supply of qualified teachers, delivering instruction through technology may be a solution to meet the demand for education. This paper analyzes the educational and labor market impacts of an expansion of junior secondary education in Mexico through telesecundariasâ€”schools using televised lessons, currently serving 1.4 million students. To isolate the effects of telesecundarias, I exploit their staggered rollout from 1968 to present. I show that for every additional telesecundaria per 50 children, ten students enroll in junior secondary education and two pursue further education. Using the telesecundaria expansion as an instrument, I find that an additional year of education induced by telesecundaria enrollment increases average income by 17.6\%. This increase in income comes partly from increased labor force participation and a shift away from agriculture and the informal sector. Since schooling decisions are sequential, the estimated returns combine the direct effect of attending telesecundarias and the effects of further schooling. I decompose these two effects by interacting the telesecundaria expansion with baseline access to upper secondary institutions. Roughly 84\% of the estimated returns come directly from junior secondary education, while the remaining 16\% are returns to higher educational levels.},

However, modern standardized testing systems are not designed to produce performance metrics for teachers or principals. They are designed to produce reliable measures of individual student achievement in a low-stakes testing environment. The design features that promote reliable measurement provide opportunities for teachers to profitably coach students on test-taking skills, and educators typically exploit these opportunities whenever modern assessments are used in high-stakes settings as vehicles for gathering information about their performance. Because these coaching responses often contaminate measures of both student achievement and educator performance, it is likely possible to acquire more accurate measures of both student achievement and education performance by developing separate assessment systems that are designed specifically for each measurement task.},

  abstract = {Many test-based accountability systems, including the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), place great weight on the numbers of students who score at or above specified proficiency levels in various subjects. Accountability systems based on these metrics often provide incentives for teachers and principals to target children near current proficiency levels for extra attention, but these same systems provide weak incentives to devote extra attention to students who are clearly proficient already or who have little chance of becoming proficient in the near term. We show based on fifth grade test scores from the Chicago Public Schools that both the introduction of NCLB in 2002 and the introduction of similar district level reforms in 1996 generated noteworthy increases in reading and math scores among students in the middle of the achievement distribution. Nonetheless, the least academically advantaged students in Chicago did not score higher in math or reading following the introduction of accountability, and we find only mixed evidence of score gains among the most advantaged students. A large existing literature argues that accountability systems built around standardized tests greatly affect the amount of time that teachers devote to different topics. Our results for fifth graders in Chicago, as well as related results for sixth graders after the 1996 reform, suggest that the choice of the proficiency standard in such accountability systems determines the amount of time that teachers devote to students of different ability levels.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} In Ghana, malaria is endemic and perennial (with significant seasonal variations in the three Northern Regions), accounting for 33 \% of all deaths among children under 5 years old, with prevalence rates in children under-five ranging from 11 \% in Greater Accra to 40 \% in Northern Region. Ghana adopted the WHO-recommended Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) strategy with a trial in the Upper West Region in 2015. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of seasonal malaria chemoprevention. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Costs were analysed from provider and societal perspectives and are reported in 2015 US\$. Data on resource use (direct and indirect costs) of the SMC intervention were collected from intervention records and a survey in all districts and at regional level. Additional numbers of malaria cases and deaths averted by the intervention were estimated based on prevalence data obtained from an SMC effectiveness study in the region. Incremental costeffectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated for the districts and region. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the ICERs. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The total financial cost of the intervention was US\$1,142,040.80. The total economic cost was estimated to be US\$7.96 million and US\$2.66 million from the societal and provider perspectives, respectively. The additional numbers of cases estimated to be averted by the intervention were 24,881 and 808, respectively. The economic cost per child dosed was US\$67.35 from societal perspective and US\$22.53 from the provider perspective. The economic cost per additional case averted was US\$107.06 from the provider perspective and US\$319.96 from the societal perspective. The economic cost per additional child death averted by the intervention was US\$3298.36 from the provider perspective and US\$9858.02 from the societal perspective. The financial cost per the SMC intervention delivered to a child under-five was US\$9.66. The ICERs were sensitive to mortality rate used. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} The SMC intervention is economically beneficial in reducing morbidity in children under-5 years and presents a viable approach to improving under-five health in Ghana.},

It is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for protecting pregnant women from the adverse effects of malaria (IPTp) and shows great potential as a strategy for reducing illness from malaria during infancy (IPTi). Administered concurrently with standard immunizations, IPTi is expected to reduce the frequency of clinical disease, but to allow blood-stage infections to occur between treatments, thus allowing parasite-specific immunity to develop. While wide deployment of IPTi is being considered, it is important to assess other potential effects. Transmission conditions, drug choice and administration schedule will likely affect the possibility of post-treatment rebound in child morbidity and mortality and the increased spread of parasite drug resistance and should be considered when implementing IPTi.},

  abstract = {The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and subsequent public health interventions have disrupted food systems all over the world. In the Philippines, where stringent lockdown rules have been implemented, households living in poverty have had to rely largely on food aid in the form of food packs distributed by local governments and private donors. An evaluation of the commonly distributed food items reveals a diet that addresses acute hunger but does not contain sufficient nutrients to promote and maintain health. Such a diet puts low-income households at a greater risk of acute and chronic disease. The negative health impact of commonly distributed food packs on food aid-dependent households shine a light on how the COVID-19 pandemic and public health policies exacerbate health inequities. A primary care perspective is essential in creating food security policies that can effectively address acute hunger and malnutrition without contributing to the long-term deleterious effects of inadequate nutrition on the health of indigent communities.},

  abstract = {Background: The benefits of integrated control of malaria, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminth infections have not been fully explored in Ghanaian schoolchildren. Objective: To assess the impact of co-administered artemether-lumefantrine plus albendazole, and artemetherlumefantrine plus albendazole plus praziquantel compared to albendazole plus praziquantel on anaemia, sustained attention, and recall in schoolchildren. Design: This three-arm, open-label intervention study was carried out in Ghana among class three schoolchildren. Artemether-lumefantrine and albendazole were co-administered to 131 schoolchildren in Study Arm 1; artemether-lumefantrine, albendazole, and praziquantel to 90 children in Study Arm 2 versus albendazole and praziquantel to 127 children in Control Arm 3. Medicines were administered to all children at least 30 min after a meal. A HemoCueâ€  photometer was used to measure haemoglobin (Hb), while the code transmission test (CTT), adapted from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch), was used to measure sustained attention and recall before-and-after interventions in June 2011 and June 2012. Results: We observed significant malaria parasite prevalence reductions of 62.8 and 59.2\% in Study Arm 1 from 24.2 to 9.0\%, pB0.01, and 59.2\% in Study Arm 2 from 26.7 to 10.9\%, pB0.01), respectively, compared to 8.93\% in Control Arm 3 (from 34.7 to 31.6\%, p!0.05). Meanwhile, anaemia prevalence reduced significantly (pB0.01) in all three study arms after interventions by 38.4\% (from 19.8 to 12.2\%), 20.7\% (from 26.6 to 21.1\%), and 36.0\% (from 28.3 to 18.1\%) in Study Arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Although the interventions had no significant effects on Hb levels, anaemia prevalence reduced insignificantly by 38.4 and 20.7\% in Study Arms 1 and 2, respectively, compared to 36.0\% in Control Arm 3. Among schoolchildren in Study Arms 1 and 2, mean CTT score improved significantly after interventions by 10.4\% (from 3.18 to 3.55, p00.01) and 20.5\% (from 2.83 to 3.56, p00.01) respectively, compared to 5.75\% in Control Arm 3 (from 2.95 to 3.13, p00.09). Likewise, mean recall test score improvements after interventions were 16.9\% (from 2.07 to 2.49, p00.01) and 27.9\% (from 1.91 to 2.65, p00.01) in Study Arms 1 and 2, respectively, compared to 18.3\% (from 1.92 to 2.35, p00.01) in Control Arm 3. Conclusion: Combined intermittent preventive treatment of malaria and deworming reduced prevalence of anaemia and improved sustained attention and recall in schoolchildren. Best results for sustained attention and recall were seen in Study Arm 2.},

This procedure employs a diverse ensemble of predictive modelsâ€”including multilevel regression, LASSO, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and gradient boostingâ€”to improve the cross-validated fit of the first-stage predictions. In a Monte Carlo simulation, SRP significantly outperforms MRP when there are deep interactions in the data generating process, without requiring the researcher to specify a complex parametric model in advance. In an empirical application, I show that SRP produces superior local public opinion estimates on a broad range of issue areas, particularly when trained on large datasets.},

The study employed a Descriptive survey design in which 11 item Likert-scale type of questionnaires was administered to 214 respondents mainly students in the second cycle and tertiary institutions of Ghana. The study employed simple random sampling technique in selecting the respondents for the study. The study revealed some challenges students encounter in the close down of schools due to the outbreak of the pandemic Covid-19. Students are unable to study effectively from the house thus, making the online system of learning very ineffective. Again, parents are incapable of assisting their wards on how to access online learning platform, neither can they entirely supervise the learning of their children at home without any complications. It came to light that the pandemic really has had a negative impact on their learning as many of them are not used to effectively learn by themselves. The e-learning platforms rolled out also poses challenge to majority of the students because of the limited access to internet and lack of the technical knowhow of these technological devices by most Ghanaian students. The study therefore recommends that students should be introduced to innovative and offline e-learning platforms to supplement classroom teaching and learning and also be of benefit to students who may not have access to internet connectivities.},

This approach combines the modeling approach often used in small-area estimation with the population information used in poststratification (see Gelman and Little 1997,               Survey Methodology               23:127â€“135). To validate the method, we apply it to U.S. preelection polls for 1988 and 1992, poststratified by state, region, and the usual demographic variables. We evaluate the model by comparing it to state-level election outcomes. The multilevel model outperforms more commonly used models in political science. We envision the most important usage of this method to be not forecasting elections but estimating public opinion on a variety of issues at the state level.},

  abstract = {Empirical support for the human capital theory across the developing world predominantly uses years of schooling as the indicator for human capital. However, the learning crisis taking place in developing countries strongly suggests that schooling quantity represents an inferior proxy for this type of analysis (World Bank, 2018). This paper relies on cognitive skills proxied by literacy skills to estimate the returns to human capital for wage workers in the urban areas of 7 developing countries. By implicitly taking into consideration school quality aspects and non-school influences in human capital formation, cognitive skills better represent the rationale of human capital theory. The results in the cross-country specification show that, on average, an increase in one standard deviation of literacy scores increases net hourly wages by 8.5\%, conditioning on years of schooling. The findings are robust to the inclusion of covariates related to socioeconomic background and alternative human capital indicators. Interestingly, returns to skills vary greatly across developing countries. This analysis implies that the empirical support for the human capital theory is remarkably heterogeneous across the developing world.},

The purpose of this paper is to review and discuss some of the new important developments in small area estimation methods. Rao [Small Area Estimation (2003)] wrote a very comprehensive book, which covers all the main developments in this topic until that time. A few review papers have been written after 2003, but they are limited in scope. Hence, the focus of this review is on new developments in the last 7â€“8 years, but to make the review more self-contained, I also mention shortly some of the older developments. The review covers both designbased and model-dependent methods, with the latter methods further classified into frequentist and Bayesian methods. The style of the paper is similar to the style of my previous review on SAE published in 2002, explaining the new problems investigated and describing the proposed solutions, but without dwelling on theoretical details, which can be found in the original articles. I hope that this paper will be useful both to researchers who like to learn more on the research carried out in SAE and to practitioners who might be interested in the application of the new methods.},

  abstract = {Using post-electoral surveys from France, Britain and the US, this paper documents a striking long-run evolution in the structure of political cleavages. In the 1950s-1960s, the vote for left-wing (socialist-labour-democratic) parties was associated with lower education and lower income voters. It has gradually become associated with higher education voters, giving rise to a â€œmultiple-eliteâ€ party system in the 2000s-2010s: high-education elites now vote for the â€œleftâ€, while highincome/high-wealth elites still vote for the â€œrightâ€ (though less and less so). I argue that this can contribute to explain rising inequality and the lack of democratic response to it, as well as the rise of â€œpopulismâ€. I also discuss the origins of this evolution (rise of globalization/migration cleavage, and/or educational expansion per se) as well as future prospects: â€œmultiple-eliteâ€ stabilization; complete realignment of the party system along a â€œglobalistsâ€ (high-education, high-income) vs â€œnativistsâ€ (loweducation, low-income) cleavage; return to class-based redistributive conflict (either from an internationalist or nativist perspective). Two main lessons emerge. First, with multi-dimensional inequality, multiple political equilibria and bifurcations can occur. Next, without a strong egalitarian-internationalist platform, it is difficult to unite loweducation, low-income voters from all origins within the same party.},

Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we examine how teachersâ€™ guides across the projects differ and find substantial variation in the design and structure of the documents. We develop a scripting index so that the scripting levels of the guides can be compared across projects. The impact results of the programs that use teachersâ€™ guides show significant impacts on learning outcomes, associated with approximately an additional half year of learning, showing that structured teachersâ€™ guides contribute to improved learning outcomes. During observations, we find that teachers make a variety of changes in their classroom instruction from how the guides are written, showing that the utilization of structured teachersâ€™ guides do not create robotic teachers unable to use their own professional skills to teach children. Unfortunately, many changes that teachers make reduce the amount of group work and interactivity that was described in the guides, suggesting that programs should encourage teachers to more heavily utilize the instructional routines designed in the guide. The report includes a set of research-based guidelines that material developers can use to develop teachersâ€™ guides that will support effective instructional practices and help improve learning outcomes. The key takeaway from the report is that structured teachers' guides improve learning outcomes, but that overly scripted teachers' guides are somewhat less effective than simplified teachers' guides that give specific guidance to the teacher but are not written word for word for each lesson in the guide.},

  abstract = {Several rigorously evaluated programs have recently shown positive effects on early literacy and numeracy outcomes in developing countries. However, these programs have not been designed to evaluate which ingredients of the interventions are most essential to improve literacy outcomes. Policy makers therefore lack evidence as to whether program ingredients such as teacher professional development (PD), instructional coaching, learner materials, teachersâ€™ guides, community support, or technology are required for program impact. The Kenya Primary Math and Reading Initiative was a randomized controlled trial that compared three treatment groups with specific ingredients and a control group. Using literacy and numeracy outcome measures for grades 1 and 2, we evaluated the benefits of the following ingredients: (1) teacher PD and teacher instructional support and coaching; (2) revised student books in literacy and numeracy, at a 1:1 ratio, added to PD and instructional support; and (3) structured teacher lesson plans added to student books, PD, and instructional support. We found that two of the three combinations of ingredients had statistically significant positive impacts on learning outcomes. The results showed that the third combinationâ€”PD, teacher instructional support and coaching, 1:1 student books, and structured teacher lesson plansâ€”was most effective. A cost-effectiveness analysis on the ingredients showed that the option of PD and instructional support, 1:1 revised books, and teachersâ€™ guides was the most expensive, but that the additional impact on learning made this the most cost-effective intervention. This study rigorously analyzes which ingredients for literacy and numeracy improvement would be most effective for overall impact, and suggests to policy makers that careful decisions regarding program ingredients will lead to more effectively designed and implemented interventions to improve learning in developing countries.},

  abstract = {Instructional coaching has improved student outcomes in the United States, and may help to solve Kenya's literacy problems. Coaching is costly, however, and evidence is lacking regarding the most costefficient teacher-to-coach ratio. We used student literacy outcome data from more than 8000 students participating in the Kenya Primary Math and Reading Initiativeda randomized controlled trial of instructional interventions in public and nonformal schoolsdto fill this gap. Coaches in larger public zones made fewer visits per teacher, and teacher-coach ratio and student performance were negatively associated. Using causal methods, we concluded that lower ratios might improve nonformal school outcomes.},

  abstract = {In the face of increasing climate volatility and stretched aid budgets, more effective ways to support households in times of crisis are needed. This paper examines the welfare impact of an anticipatory cash transfer provided to households forecasted to experience extreme floods in Bangladesh. Evidence on the impact of a one-off transfer in a disaster are limited, despite the widespread use of such transfers in crises, reflecting more broadly a dearth of evaluations in the humanitarian sector. To assess impact, we exploit administrative constraints experienced during the programme roll-out caused by the quick onset of the flood and restrictions on movement as a result of Covid-19, to compare treated households with otherwise comparable households which did not receive the cash transfer. We find that the anticipatory cash transfer was mostly spent on food and water, and that treated households were 36\% less likely to go a day without eating during the flood. Three months after the flood, households that had received the transfer reported significantly higher child and adult food consumption and wellbeing. They also experienced lower asset loss, engaged in less costly borrowing after the flood, and reported higher earning potential. Our results are robust to alternate control group definitions and model specifications. These benefits from the anticipatory cash transfer occurred before a traditional humanitarian response would normally arrive, highlighting the benefits of being early. We find that small changes in timing matter: receiving the cash a day earlier resulted in a small and marginally significant increase in welfare.},

  abstract = {In survey sampling practice, unequal sampling weights (the inverse of the selection probabilities) can be both beneficial and deleterious. Extreme variation in the sampling weights can result in excessively large sampling variances when the data and the selection probabilities are not positively correlated. In addition, extreme variation in the weights can result from unplanned subsampling, nonresponse adjustments, or post-stratification. In some survey situations, the survey statistician may impose a trimming strategy for excessively large weights. Because of the weight trimming, the survey statistician will usually expect an increased potential for a bias in the estimate and a decrease in the sampling variance. The ultimate goal of weight trimming is to reduce the sampling variance more than enough to compensate for the possible increase in bias and, thereby, reduce the mean square error. In this paper, we discuss some current methods used to identify the appropriate trimming values and provide guidance on selecting the final trimming level, which may be different from the values suggested by the algorithms.},

First, do differences in the evolution and dynamics of schooling help explain the big facts about the evolution and dynamics of output growth? Largely, no. Second, the existence and magnitude of output externalities to schooling is an important question with possible normative policy implications, and evidence for externalities requires at least some level of spatial aggregation. Does the cross-national data provide support for output externalities? Largely, no. Third, crossnational (or more broadly spatially aggregated) data allows the exploration of the impact on returns to schooling (or in the gap between private and social returns) of differences in economic environments. This last question seems a promising line for future research.},

  abstract = {We discuss the value of experiments in illuminating constraints on the growth of firms in developing countries. Experiments have provided insight into both the value and the difficulty of alleviating capital constraints in small firms. They suggest that urban, low-skilled labor markets appear to work reasonably well for firms, although there is a suggestion that frictions in markets for skilled workers may have more effect on firms. While observational data suggest that managerial training is important, experiments have shown that the traditional methods of delivering this training to small enterprises, at least, are not effective. Finally, while most work has focused on alleviating supply constraints, recent experiments have shown that positive demand shocks can be sufficient to generate firm growth. Experiments have been particularly illuminating in uncovering patterns in individual decision making, showing how agents respond to the specific changes in circumstances or incentives generated by the experiment. They are most valuable when they complement insight driven by theory.},

  author = {Ragusa, Giuseppe},
  pages = {81},
  abstract = {This paper considers estimation and inference using Minimum Divergence (MD) techniques. MD estimators are obtained by minimizing a divergence between the empirical distribution and the distribution implied by moment restrictions. Methods that have received attention as possible alternatives to GMM, such as Empirical Likelihood, Exponential Tilting and Continuous Updating, are all special cases of Minimum Divergence estimators. The paper makes the following main contributions. First, it proves that there is a relationship between the Generalized Empirical Likelihood (GEL) class of estimators and the MD class that extends beyond the known cases. Second, a Bayesian interpretation of the weighting scheme through which the MD reweighs the observations is given. Third, it is shows that all the members of the MD class that have the same asymptotic bias of Empirical Likelihood are third-order eÂ¢ cient. This result implies that higher order eÂ¢ ciency is an inadequate criterion for prescribing which speciâ€¦c estimator should be used in applied work. I argue that in selecting from the class of third order eÂ¢ cient estimators, one should consider the boundedness of the inâ€¡uence function. Monte Carlo simulations show that test statistics based on estimators that are third order eÂ¢ cient and have a bounded inâ€¡uence function have smaller size distortion in â€¦nite sample than tests based on third order eÂ¢ cient estimators with unbounded inâ€¡uence function.},

  abstract = {Education has become competitive and so too the educational institutions. In order to survive the competition, institutions have to improve the quality of their services. Changes in culture, aspiration and levels of skills required in securing employment for students, force higher education institutions today to rework on their educational models and add value to each and every aspect of their service. Innovations and best practices serve to enhance quality and add value. Srinivas Institute of Management Studies (SIMS), which combines technology, management and social service education has identified and implemented innovations and best practices to differentiate itself among the competitors and to add value in its educational services. In this paper, we have discussed innovations, small and big, develped indigineously and implemented during last four years. They are broadly classified under six key aspects namely "curriculat aspects, teaching-learning and evaluation, research, consultancy and extension, infrastructure and learning resources, student support and progression, and governance, leadership, and management". The paper also contains some of the intitutional and individual faculty best practices having visible impact on the quality of higher education imparted by the institution. The best practices concern admission, fees, attendance, teaching, performance, skill building, emploability, student involvement, collectively learning, value addition, ensuring tranperency, information desipitation etc. Finally two institutional best practices are elaborated with its aim of practice, underlying principles and concepts, particular contextual features or challenging issues that have had to be addressed in designing and implementing the practice, and its implementation, including its uniqueness in Indian higher education, evidence of success, identifing the problems encountered and resources required to implement the practice.},

Indiaâ€™s cities are large, economically important, and growing. However, neither urban infrastructure nor the level of urban public services is adequate for current needs, let alone to meet growing demands. Dealing with this problem is a formidable challenge. Not only must adequate finance for the provision of services be found but it is critical to ensure that the money spent results in desired outputs and outcomes. To do so, local governance structures also need to be reformed and strengthened. This paper attempts to point the way towards some possible solutions by analysing urban governance and finance in India in the context of lessons drawn from fiscal federalism theory and experiences of governance institutions and financing systems both in India and around the world.},

The paper takes stock of the issues. It argues that an unconditional preference for RCTs is questionable on three main counts. First, the case for such a preference is unclear on a priori grounds. For example, with a given budget, even a biased observational study can come closer to the truth than a costly RCT. Second, the ethical objections to RCTs have not been properly addressed by advocates. Third, there is a risk of distorting the evidence-base for informing policymaking, given that an insistence on RCTs generates selection bias in what gets evaluated. Going forward, pressing knowledge gaps should drive the questions asked and how they are answered, not the methodological preferences of some researchers. The gold standard is the best method for the question at hand.},

On the basis of a review of existing literature, this article presents principles for donors, governments and advocates to help them design more effective reform programmes. Although the current understanding of how best to promote civil service reform has advanced, it remains broadly incomplete because of a combination of the complexity of the subject, disagreement on the objectives, and a failure of practitioners to reflect on their experiences and then disseminate the results.

Likely causes of anemia are low bioavailability of dietary iron, malaria, and helminth infection. In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of iron fortification, intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) of malaria, and anthelmintic treatment on hemoglobin concentration and anemia prevalence among school children. The study was a 6-mo, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial enrolling 591 6- to 14-y-old school children in CoË† te dâ€™Ivoire using the following: 1) iron-fortified biscuits providing an additional 20 mg iron/d as electrolytic iron 4 times/wk; 2) IPT of malaria with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine at 0 and 3 mo; and 3) anthelmintic treatment at 0 and 3 mo as the interventions. Prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency, malaria parasitemia, and helminth infection was 70.4, 9.3, 57.7, and 54.8\%, respectively. Iron fortification did not improve iron status, IPT of malaria did not affect malaria burden, and neither had an impact on anemia prevalence. Anthelmintics significantly reduced the burden of helminth infections and decreased anemia prevalence (odds ratio: 0.4, 95\% CI: 0.3, 0.7). The low prevalence of iron deficiency and an extended dry season that decreased malaria transmission likely reduced the potential impact of iron fortification and IPT. In this setting, anthelmintic treatment was the only intervention that modestly decreased rates of anemia. J. Nutr. 140: 635â€“641, 2010.},

In this paper, we revisit the program two years later. After the first year, treatment effects on learning gains plateaued (e.g., the intention-to-treat effect on English was .18Ïƒ after one year, and .16Ïƒ after three years, equivalent to 4 words per minute additional reading fluency for the cohort that started in first grade). Looking beyond learning gains, the program reduced corporal punishment (by 4.6 percentage points from a base of 51\%), but increased dropout (by 3.3 percentage points from a base of 15\%) and failed to reduce sexual abuse. Behind these average effects, the identity of the contractor mattered. Despite facing similar contracts and settings, some providers produced uniformly positive results, while others present stark trade-offs between learning gains, access to education, child safety, and financial sustainability.},

The leading method for assessing teacher quality is "value added" modeling (VAM), which decomposes students' test scores into components attributed to student heterogeneity and to teacher quality. Implicit in the VAM approach are strong assumptions about the nature of the educational production function and the assignment of students to classrooms. In this paper, I develop falsification tests for three widely used VAM specifications, based on the idea that future teachers cannot influence students' past achievement. In data from North Carolina, each of the VAMs' exclusion restrictions are dramatically violated. In particular, these models indicate large "effects" of 5th grade teachers on 4th grade test score gains. I also find that conventional measures of individual teachers' value added fade out very quickly and are at best weakly related to long-run effects.},

CFR (2014b) finds VA scores are useful proxies for teachersâ€™ effects on studentsâ€™ long-run outcomes. I successfully reproduce each in North Carolina data. But I find that the quasi-experiment is invalid, as teacher switching is correlated with changes in student preparedness. Adjusting for this, I find moderate bias in VA scores, perhaps 10-35\% as large, in variance terms, as teachersâ€™ causal effects. Long-run results are sensitive to controls and cannot support strong conclusions.},

Unfortunately, it is uncertain how much learning will be lost and how wide the gaps may be for disadvantaged children. This paper uses a unique longitudinal dataset to estimate learning loss during a three-month transition from Complementary Basic Education to government schools in Ghana. Our results show an average learning loss of 66 \% of previous learning gains in foundational numeracy during this transition period. More importantly, we estimate widening gaps in learning loss according to lack of home learning support, as well as lack of home learning resources. Our results have implications for the provision of learning activities and support at home, not just during current school closures due to COVID-19, but also during transitions between academic years.},

By using systematic search and screening techniques to populate the repository, which contains 4,205 development impact evaluations published between 1981 and September 2015, we can use the data to analyse the trends in impact evaluation research. Though we find early evidence of a plateau in the growth rate of development impact evaluations, the number of studies published between January 2010 and September 2015 account for almost two thirds of the total evidence base. Over half of all studies fall under health and education sectors, though we see in the current decade an emergence of studies in formerly unrepresented sectors. While development impact evaluations are concentrated in SubSaharan Africa and Latin America (60\%), studies are increasingly conducted in underrepresented regions such as the Middle East and North Africa.},

  abstract = {Ã Cash transfer programs create multiplier eÂ€ects when recipients put the money they receive to work to generate further incomes. When this is the case, the ultimate income eÂ€ects are multiples of the amounts transferred. We analyze the PROCAMPO program in Mexico that was introduced to compensate farmers for the anticipated negative eÂ€ect of NAFTA on the prices of basic crops. The transfer rules and the timing of the panel data collected allow unique control of biases in this impact analysis. We Â®nd that the multiplier among ejido sector recipients is in the range 1.5Â±2.6. Multipliers are higher for households with medium and large farms, low numbers of adults in the household, nonindigenous backgrounds, and located in the Center and Gulf regions. High multipliers reÂ¯ect income opportunities that had remained unrealized due to liquidity constraints that are relaxed by the transfers. Opportunities come from the asset endowments that these households received through the land reform, particularly irrigated land, and they are enhanced by access to technical assistance.

In contrast to alternative DID estimators, the proposed estimators are consistent if either (but not necessarily both) a propensity score or outcome regression working models are correctly specified. We also derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when the working models are correctly specified. Furthermore, we quantify the potential efficiency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying articular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference. Simulation studies and an empirical application illustrate the desirable finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators. Open-source software for implementing the proposed policy evaluation tools is available.},

The theory is grounded in the causal inference and HLM modeling literature, and the empirical work focuses on commonly-used designs in education research to test intervention effects on student test scores. The main conclusion is that three to four times larger samples are typically required under RD than experimental clustered designs to produce impacts with the same level of statistical precision. Thus, the viability of using RD designs for new impact evaluations of educational interventions may be limited, and will depend on the point of treatment assignment, the availability of pretests, and key research questions.},

It does not contain substantive updates on our research and recommendations. GiveWell â€“ both our traditional work and GiveWell Labs â€“ is fundamentally about maximization: doing as much good as possible with each dollar you donate. This introduces some major conceptual challenges when making certain kinds of comparisons â€“ for example, how does one compare the impact of distributing bednets in sub-Saharan Africa with the impact of funding research on potential high-risk responses to climate change, attempts to promote better collaboration in the scientific community or working against abuse of animals on factory farms ? Our approach to making such comparisons strikes some as highly counterintuitive, and noticeably different from that of other â€œprioritizationâ€ projects such as  Copenhagen Consensus. Rather than focusing on a single metric that all â€œgood accomplishedâ€ can be converted into (an approach that has obvious advantages when oneâ€™s goal is to maximize), we tend to rate options based on a variety of criteria using something somewhat closer to (while distinct from) a â€œ1=poor, 5=excellentâ€ scale, and prioritize options that score well on multiple criteria. (For example, see our most recent top charities comparison.) We often take approaches that effectively limit the weight carried by any one criterion, even though, in theory, strong enough performance on an important enough dimension ought to be able to offset any amount of weakness on other dimensions. Relatedly, we look into a broad variety of causes, broader than can seemingly be justified by a consistent and stable set of values. Many others in the effective altruist community seem to have a strong and definite opinion on questions such as â€œhow much animals suffer compared to humans,â€ such that they either prioritize animal welfare above all else or dismi},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Declining donor funding and competing health priorities threaten the sustainability of malaria programmes. Elucidating the cost and benefits of continued investments in malaria could encourage sustained political and financial commitments. The evidence, although available, remains disparate. This paper reviews the existing literature on the economic and financial cost and return of malaria control, elimination and eradication. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} A review of articles that were published on or before September 2014 on the cost and benefits of malaria control and elimination was performed. Studies were classified based on their scope and were analysed according to two major categories: cost of malaria control and elimination to a health system, and cost-benefit studies. Only studies involving more than two control or elimination interventions were included. Outcomes of interest were total programmatic cost, cost per capita, and benefit-cost ratios (BCRs). All costs were converted to 2013 US\$ for standardization. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Of the 6425 articles identified, 54 studies were included in this review. Twenty-two were focused on elimination or eradication while 32 focused on intensive control. Forty-eight per cent of studies included in this review were published on or after 2000. Overall, the annual per capita cost of malaria control to a health system ranged from \$0.11 to \$39.06 (median: \$2.21) while that for malaria elimination ranged from \$0.18 to \$27 (median: \$3.00). BCRs of investing in malaria control and elimination ranged from 2.4 to over 145. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Overall, investments needed for malaria control and elimination varied greatly amongst the various countries and contexts. While the cost of elimination in most cases was greater than the cost of control, the benefits greatly outweighed the cost. Information from this review provides guidance to national malaria programmes on the cost and benefits of malaria elimination in the absence of data. Importantly, the review highlights the need for more robust economic analyses using standard inputs and methods to strengthen the evidence needed for sustained financing for malaria elimination.},

  abstract = {How important is the differential productivity of primary schooling across countries in explaining international differences in human capital? In this paper, I present the first micro-econometric evidence on this issue using a unique child-level panel dataset with linked assessments of quantitative ability at 5 and 8 years of age from four developing countries â€“ Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam. I first document that although some cross-country gaps in test scores are evident already at 5 years of age, prior to school entry, these gaps grow substantially in the first years of schooling: children in Vietnam consistently score highest on average followed by Peru, India and Ethiopia respectively. Using value-added estimates, together with an RD/IV approach using discontinuities in grade completion arising due to month of birth and country-specific enrolment guidelines, I document sizable cross-country differences in the productivity of a school year. School year productivity, measured as learning-gains-per-grade-completed, varies from 0.45 SD-per-year in Vietnam to, for example, 0.2 SD-per-year in Peru. This differential productivity of a year in primary school, rather than differences in child endowments, nutrition, background characteristics or time use, largely explains the early divergence between Vietnam and other countries: equalizing this parameter to Vietnamese levels, leaving all endowments including learning at 5 years unchanged, closes the entire achievement gap between Vietnam and Peru, and 70\% of the gap between Vietnam and India, at 8 years of age.},

  abstract = {A central, yet understudied, component of state capacity is the quality of administrative data, which is a key enabler of effective policy making. I study this in the context of education systems in India. Using direct audit evidence, I show that levels of student achievement in Madhya Pradesh, from a large census covering approximately 7 million students annually, are severely inflated due to cheating. This distortion affects students at all levels of achievement but is particularly severe for low-performing students. In a follow-up randomized experiment, covering over 2400 schools in a different state (Andhra Pradesh), I evaluate whether tablet-based testing, which makes cheating harder, could reduce distortion. I find paper-based assessments proctored by teachers severely exaggerate achievement, in both private and government schools, but find no evidence of such distortion in tablet-based assessments. These results suggest that business-as-usual learning assessments may be compromised even without high-powered incentives, limiting their usefulness for policy action or research, although it may be possible to curtail such manipulation even at scale. This challenge of data corruptibility, and potentially evidence on reforms to address it, is likely to generalize across sectors.},

In this paper, I show that large gaps in the test scores of children in private and public sector education are evident even at the point of initial enrolment in formal schooling and are associated with previous attendance in private and public preschools. Children in the sample were aged between 4.5 and 6 years at the time of the survey and were tested on receptive vocabulary and quantitative skills. Most (albeit not all) children in the sample had attended private and/or government preschools and at the time of the survey, about 44\% had made a transition into formal schooling. Attending private pre-schools is associated with substantially, and significantly, higher test scores relative to attending public preschools. A considerable portion of this difference can be removed by controls for parental background and selected child characteristics but the gap remains significant. Possible implications of these results are discussed.},

  abstract = {At a superficial level, the idea of maximum likelihood must be prehistoric: early hunters and gatherers may not have used the words ``method of maximum likelihood'' to describe their choice of where and how to hunt and gather, but it is hard to believe they would have been surprised if their method had been described in those terms. It seems a simple, even unassailable idea: Who would rise to argue in favor of a method of minimum likelihood, or even mediocre likelihood? And yet the mathematical history of the topic shows this ``simple idea'' is really anything but simple. Joseph Louis Lagrange, Daniel Bernoulli, Leonard Euler, Pierre Simon Laplace and Carl Friedrich Gauss are only some of those who explored the topic, not always in ways we would sanction today. In this article, that history is reviewed from back well before Fisher to the time of Lucien Le Cam's dissertation. In the process Fisher's unpublished 1930 characterization of conditions for the consistency and efficiency of maximum likelihood estimates is presented, and the mathematical basis of his three proofs discussed. In particular, Fisher's derivation of the information inequality is seen to be derived from his work on the analysis of variance, and his later approach via estimating functions was derived from Euler's Relation for homogeneous functions. The reaction to Fisher's work is reviewed, and some lessons drawn.},

  abstract = {In the field of educational assessment, the "validity of assessment" can be defined as the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores that are entailed by proposed uses of the test. Many concerns have arisen over what is termed the "consequential basis" of validity, the intended and unintended social consequences of testing. In this article, the authors review the long history of the Keju exam system, that became central in a government-orchestrated system of high-stakes employment testing, education testing, and test-driven education. The authors find that problems such as memorizing and reproducing model performances, focusing on test-taking skills, cheating, and psychopathological effects, are the same problems recurred throughout the ages. Rater effects were largely controlled through a number of procedural designs. However, repeated attempts to control other sources of irrelevance led to these problems mutating to different forms. The authors suggest that test theorists and psychometricians need to develop appropriate and realistic models of scoring or of the use of assessment results in which such chronic consequential factors are accepted as inevitable components of the score or of the system. From the perspective of policy decisions, it does not appear that the solution will be found in designing procedures to stop such chronic problems. Rather, it will most likely come from taking measures to minimize the stakes of tests. (Contains 49 footnotes.)}

Our estimates are based on three scenarios: low, medium, and high global contractions of 5, 10, and 20 per cent; we calculate the impact of each of these scenarios on the poverty headcount using the international poverty lines of US\$1.90, US\$3.20 and US\$5.50 per day. Our estimates show that COVID-19 poses a real challenge to the UN Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030 because global poverty could increase for the first time since 1990 and, depending on the poverty line, such increase could represent a reversal of approximately a decade in the worldâ€™s progress in reducing poverty. In some regions the adverse impacts could result in poverty levels similar to those recorded 30 years ago. Under the most extreme scenario of a 20 per cent income or consumption contraction, the number of people living in poverty could increase by 420â€“580 million, relative to the latest official recorded figures for 2018.},

I offer a simple explanation for this: benefits and costs of technologies are heterogeneous, so that farmers with low net returns do not adopt the technology. I examine this hypothesis by estimating a correlated random coefficient model of yields and the corresponding distribution of returns to hybrid maize. This distribution indicates that the group of farmers with the highest estimated gross returns does not use hybrid, but their returns are correlated with high costs of acquiring the technology (due to poor infrastructure). Another group of farmers has lower returns and adopts, while the marginal farmers have zero returns and switch in and out of use over the sample period. Overall, adoption decisions appear to be rational and well explained by (observed and unobserved) variation in heterogeneous net benefits to the technology.},

One such instance occurred in the Colonial Indian provinces, where incumbent elites hollowed out tax capacity in anticipation of franchise expansion. While studies of intra-elite competition have focused on economic inequality as a key factor in shaping elite motivations, this paper finds that high-caste elites in the colonial era, who were worried about their status dominance, weakened institutions in order to limit the ability of future elected lower castes to integrate public goods to lower castes. As elite bureaucrats as well as local tax collectors, upper castes enabled tax avoidance and exited the local bureaucratic machinery. Using a historical dataset from 1914-1925 and novel micro-level measures of land tax collection, tax avoidance, and the size of the bureaucracy, the paper demonstrates that bureaucratic capacity declined after franchise expansion in the districts with higher levels of inter-caste status inequality.},

  abstract = {Background: Awareness of the potential impact of malaria among school-age children has stimulated investigation into malaria interventions that can be delivered through schools. However, little evidence is available on the costs and cost-effectiveness of intervention options. This paper evaluates the costs and cost-effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) as delivered by teachers in schools in western Kenya. Methods: Information on actual drug and non-drug associated costs were collected from expenditure and salary records, government budgets and interviews with key district and national officials. Effectiveness data were derived from a cluster-randomised-controlled trial of IPT where a single dose of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and three daily doses of amodiaquine were provided three times in year (once termly). Both financial and economic costs were estimated from a provider perspective, and effectiveness was estimated in terms of anaemia cases averted. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of key assumptions on estimated costeffectiveness. Results: The delivery of IPT by teachers was estimated to cost US\$ 1.88 per child treated per year, with drug and teacher training costs constituting the largest cost components. Set-up costs accounted for 13.2\% of overall costs (equivalent to US\$ 0.25 per child) whilst recurrent costs accounted for 86.8\% (US\$ 1.63 per child per year). The estimated cost per anaemia case averted was US\$ 29.84 and the cost per case of Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia averted was US\$ 5.36, respectively. The cost per case of anaemia averted ranged between US\$ 24.60 and 40.32 when the prices of antimalarial drugs and delivery costs were varied. Cost-effectiveness was most influenced by effectiveness of IPT and the background prevalence of anaemia. In settings where 30\% and 50\% of schoolchildren were anaemic, cost-effectiveness ratios were US\$ 12.53 and 7.52, respectively. Conclusion: This study provides the first evidence that IPT administered by teachers is a cost-effective schoolbased malaria intervention and merits investigation in other settings.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Malaria is still a public health problem in Africa. Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) is an efficient control strategy recommended by WHO that targets children under five year old living in areas of seasonal malaria transmission. SMC uses the combination amodiaquine (AQ) â€“ sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). However SP selects rapidly drug resistant parasites. And malaria burden may increase in older children where SMC is implemented. We initiated a pilot study to assess an alternative approach to SMC in older children in Mali. Methods: A randomized open-label clinical trial was conducted to test the efficacy and safety of SMC using artesunate â€“ amodiaquine in school aged children in Mali. Two hundred pupils aged 6â€“15 years old were enrolled and randomized into two arms of 100 each, to receive either artesunateâ€“amodiaquine (ASAQ) monthly or no intervention. Both arms were followed and clinical malaria were diagnosed and treated with arthemeter-lumefanthrine as recommended by Mali National Malaria Control Program. ASAQ was administered 3 days under study team direct observation and during 4 consecutive months starting in October 2013. Follow up was continued until April 2014. Results: Overall, 20 cases of uncomplicated clinical malaria were encountered in the Control arm and three cases in the ASAQ arm, showing a protective efficacy of 85\% 95\% CI [80.1â€“89.9] against clinical malaria. Protective efficacy against malaria infection was 69.6\% 95\% CI [58.6â€“21.4]. No effect on anemia was observed. ASAQ was well tolerated. Most common solicited adverse events were abdominal pain and headaches of mild intensity in respectively 64\% and 44\% of children that swallowed ASAQ. Conclusion: ASAQ is effective and well tolerated as SMC targeting older children in a peri urban setting in Mali. Its administration at schools is a feasible and accepted strategy to deliver the intervention.},

The challenges to present local government and primary education reforms are therefore considerable.

Included studies either identified specific cases of assessment results being used by policymakers to inform education reform in their systems, or identified specific cases when assessment results had no impact on education policy in specific education systems. The review classified the available evidence to address the questions: what types of assessments have impacted education policy in the region? ; what are the intended uses of assessments? ; how are assessment data used in education policy? ; what education policies have been informed by assessments? ; and what factors influence the use of assessments in education policy?

While researching private schools in India for the World Bank, and worried he was doing little to help the poor, Tooley wandered into the slums of Hyderabad's Old City. Shocked to find it overflowing with tiny, parentfunded schools filled with energized students, he set out to discover if schools like these could help achieve universal education. Named after Mahatma Gandhi's phrase for the schools of pre-colonial India, The Beautiful Tree recounts Tooley's journey from the largest shanty town in Africa to the hinterlands of Gansu, China. It introduces readers to the families and teachers who taught him that the poor are not waiting for educational handouts. They are building their own schools and educating themselves.--Amazon.},

  abstract = {This chapter considers research on the effects of competition between private and public schools. It focuses on three questions: (1) Do children experience higher achievement gains in private school? (2) If so, is this because private schools are more productive? (3) Does competition from private schools raise public school productivity and/or otherwise affect those â€œleft behindâ€? The chapter shows that unless each of these questions is answered, one cannot form a full assessment on the desirability of private school entry. Voucher experiments suggest that question 1 can be answered in the affirmative for some subgroups and in some contexts. Such work cannot typically isolate channels, however, and hence does not address question 2. Question 3 has been primarily studied by papers on large-scale voucher programs. These suggest that private school entry results in nonrandom sorting of students, but are less clear on the effects. The bottom line is that despite demand for clear, simple conclusions on the effects of competition from private schools, research does not yet provide these.},

  abstract = {In India, more than 276 million children and youth were out of school for extended periods since March 2020 due to school closures in response to COVID-19. A key challenge has been how to measure the impact of reÂ­ sponses to continuity of learning both to ensure more effective responses in the event of further disruptions, but also to help the education community conceptualize more creative and effective approaches to learning, through blended and flexible approaches. This study reflects on the findings from a UNICEF survey targeting parents and adolescents across 6 states in India, and identifies lessons learned for addressing learning inequities during future school closures. We focus on measuring three key variables â€“ access to technology, their utilization, and perceived learning for different profiles of children. As students began learning from home, technology access rates in households were initially used to determine the estimated maximum reach of different distance learning modalities during school closures. Beyond access, we find significant variations in adolescentsâ€™ use of technology for learning purposes and their perceptions of learning, linked to the type of remote learning modality, gender, location and type of school. We discuss the implications for government strategies and policies to ensure better utilization of technologies which are available in households and to address equity gaps in learning opportunities.},

Both standard and augmented Mincerian wage equations are estimated using a set of human capital measures and other controls after addressing the issue of potential selection bias. This paper finds that the returns to education are significantly different for the two types of workersâ€”while casual workers face at best flat returns to education, the returns to education for regular workers are positive and U-shaped with respect to education levels. There is also some evidence of a widening wage gap between regular workers with graduate and primary education that could possibly be a consequence of trade liberalization and other reforms pursued during the 1990s.},

  abstract = {The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme aims to provide food supplementation, immunization, health check-ups, and early childhood education to children under the age of six years. There is mounting evidence that links poverty, undernutrition, and lack of stimulation at early ages with cognitive and economic disadvantages later in life. Furthermore, early childhood nutritional, educational, and health interventions are associated with human capital gains in developing countries. In this paper, we investigate the medium-term impact of ICDS services received in early childhood on subsequent reading and arithmetic achievement among children in the ages of eight to 11 in India. There are no nationwide studies that investigate the impact of ICDS on cognitive outcomes. Utilizing data from the two waves of the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) and applying propensity score matching, we find that ICDS has a positive impact on cognitive achievement, primarily for girls and children in low-income families. Since the influence of ICDS intervention is observed for these groups, we believe that the ICDS plays a critical role in reducing gender and income-related gaps in cognitive achievement in India.},

Across generations, the health and education of parentsâ€”particularly mothersâ€”boost both outcomes in their children.},

  abstract = {When do children become unequal in reading and math skills? Some research claims that inequality grows mainly before school begins. Some research claims that schools cause inequality to grow. And some researchâ€”including the 2004 study â€˜â€˜Are Schools the Great Equalizer?â€™â€™â€”claims that inequality grows mainly during summer vacations. Unfortunately, the test scores used in the Great Equalizer study suffered from a measurement artifact that exaggerated estimates of inequality growth. In addition, the Great Equalizer study is dated and its participants are no longer school-aged. In this article, we replicate the Great Equalizer study using better test scores in both the original data and a newer cohort of children. When we use the new test scores, we find that variance is substantial at the start of kindergarten and does not grow but actually shrinks over the next two to three years. This finding, which was not evident in the original Great Equalizer study, implicates the years before kindergarten as the primary source of inequality in elementary reading and math. Total score variance grows during most summers and shrinks during most school years, suggesting that schools reduce inequality overall. Changes in inequality are small after kindergarten and do not replicate consistently across grades, subjects, or cohorts. That said, socioeconomic gaps tend to shrink during the school year and grow during the summer, while the black-white gap tends to follow the opposite pattern.},

The planned roll-out in the UK will involve vaccinating people in high-risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later. Here, we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered.},

I address the endogeneity of human and physical capital with two exogenous shocks: the dismissal of scientists in Nazi Germany and World War II bombings. A 10\% shock to human capital reduced output by 0.2 SD in the short run, and the reduction persisted in the long run. A 10\% shock to physical capital reduced output by 0.05 SD in the short run, and the reduction did not persist. The dismissal of star scientists caused much larger reductions in output because they are key for attracting other successful scientists.},

Implications for global education efforts to improve learning outcomes are discussed.},

In England, the role of the social class struggle, as Marx and Engelsâ€™ the Manifest of the Communist Party (Marx and Engels, 1959) noted, was important in the development of primary education as well. In the meantime, in Japan, the government was pushing forward with the tasks of modernization and basically took the initiative, but peopleâ€™s reactions were also essential. Despite this difference, the cases of these countries had common historical and social backgrounds and showed commonness in the processes of setting and achieving tasks. The motives for the completion of universalization were derived, on the one hand, from the demands of the society which asked for the welfare of children and, on the other, the interests of statism which were related to imperialism and militarism.},

  abstract = {Background: Imported cases of infectious disease provide invaluable information about epidemiological conditions abroad, and should guide treatment decisions at home and abroad. Here, we examined cases of malaria imported from Africa to China for mutations eroding the efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), sometimes used as an intermittent preventive treatment during for pregnant women and infants. Methods: A total of 208 blood samples were collected from P. falciparum-infected workers who had returned from Western and Central Africa to Guangxi Province Frequency distribution. Samples were analyzed for the mutations in dhfr and dhps genes by PCR -sequencing. The prevalence of dhfr and dhps polymorphisms was analyzed. Among the isolates, polymorphisms were detected in mutants N51I, C59R, S108N and I164L of Pfdhfr and I431V, S436 A/F, A437G, K540 E/N, A581G and A613T of pfdhps. Results: Mutations promoting drug resistance were widespread in this cohort. For pfdhfr and pfdhps, wild types were equally rare among patients returned from Western Africa and Central Africa. A triple-mutant dhfr haplotype was most prevalent ({$>$} 70\%). We report for the first time mutation I164L-dhfr and I431V-dhps in Ghana, and for the first time we found A581G to exceed a clinically-relevant threshold that may counter-indicate current clinical practices. For Pfdhps, the double-mutant IAGKAA was high prevalent haplotype in Ghana, Western Africa. The single-mutant ISGKAA was a majority haplotype in Cameroon. Alarmingly, a â€œsuper resistanceâ€ quintuple mutant was detected, for the first time, in parasites of West African origin (defined by IAGKAA/IRNI in combination with pfdhps 581G and dhfr I164L). This may limit the efficacy of this drug combination for even intermittent clinical applications. Conclusions: These data are cause for great concern and call for continued surveillance of the efficacy of SP in source and recipient populations, and should be considered when developing treatment policy for imported malaria cases in China and elsewhere.},
